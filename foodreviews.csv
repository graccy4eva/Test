Justin ate a starcrunch before the challenge... Big guy ate dinner lol !

Boring is natural. Fighting against it will just set you back in some brutal way down the line.
When I have Chinese food (lunch special) Ill get a mugs root beer or a coke
Sprite or 7-UP for me
Another Killer Video That I Missed!!!!!!!!!  STELLAR!!!!!!!!
orange fanta is bomb with Chinese takeout
Mrs chow
Bro your vids are so relaxing
Hidden a Chinese food baby¢
Water man I gota drink water with Chinese
So damn awesome man you kick ass
Yeah covid sucks. I think you will love Traveling! I grew up in the military and I have lived all over. England
Vietnamese iced coffee always a must with Chinese food
teeth on the silverware
Diet Coke Sparkling water Diet ginger ale Maybe diet root beer I think Diet Pepsi is great too
Arizona green tea
I just figured out why Im hooked on your channel
I drink my favorite Diet Pepsi....
Your stories are amazing keep the good vibes up hoody
Love your mukbangs  keep them coming. God bless you!
Your Chinese muckbangs were always my favorite!!
I fucking love this video. I love you so much I love watching all vids you make 
Diet pepsi goes with everything sweetheart!! Lol!!Watched u for a long time now!...
thank you
I could not agree with a story more!!! Im now 32 and think back to all the crazy fun shit I used to do and I miss so much what life used to be before adulting.  Careless and exciting
We have a chinese joint here that has meat in their food that&#39;s tender
Green tea is the drink to pair up with chinese food. çµ the hot tea melts or cuts through all the fatty oil that is in the delicious  meal.  Chinese food is so delicious but oily!oh my! Your wild story!
You would love living here in the states in DC.  Its literally those random encounters all the time but doesn&#39;t have to be like a degenerate night either although those are the best but its like a mini NY city but to me nicer
hes the best
Wow I can relate to what your saying deeply! I&#39;m in my thirties and I moved from Florida to New York 4 years ago and I miss the &quot;chaotic&quot; things! Ive settled down tremendously! I miss it! I have a great job now and a home but I have that devil in me too that misses those fun times...
u cant assert with absolute that nothing would happen in the area u live in coz life is a variable and unpredictable no matter how u think its
dude is not just visually amazing
Can we get a story time of how you and mrs hoody broke upp
Chinese Meal and a very Large Thai Tea
I like arnold palmers
I think Ireland would love you!
You nailed it on this one for sure sir!
Rum and coke
That red sauce (I never remember the proper name -- Sweet and sour sauce..?) is so amazing on fried rice.Epic party
From what I&#39;ve seen
Get back over this way for a mini vacay..get that party vibe taken care of!! Dont make me come there lol
Hi. New sub
Totally relate to the grieving of your old life. I recently had a baby
Love you but women man not girls..
Hey!!! You have a new fan 
I feel you on this brodie. Just gotta look at your life as chapters to a book. You would get tired of that lifestyle if you had unlimited access to it. Thats why the memories are all the more sweeter. The only piece of advice I could give is get out of your comfort zone. Embrace change
Ohhhh yummy
This was a great story time.
Now this is the Hoody I like. Great food and storytime!
Hey great video man do another live stream tonight if you can last night stream was hella chill
Im sure many folks have the angle and devil thing going. I know I do. On the other hand you dont have to let life get stagnant by any means. Yes there is this bs going on right now but you can still travel and vacation. Unfortunately traveling right now has some restrictions but live life man. Find a nice balance∞
SO close to 60k!!! Come on lit cigs....take us over the top!!! lol I&#39;ve also filed the paperwork on said &quot;saucing your whole rice&quot; lawsuit &amp; there may be a skinless cat one to follow shortly. (food was looking on point btw)
Stay away from the devils powder
Fire vid
Literally was like I wanna watch Chinese food mukbangs and boom my fav guy was just chilling in my notifications 
I understand what youre going through. Growing up
I want some Chinese food now 
Chinese food is life
8 months ago was his last Chinese food mukbang
Love what you are saying and get it x
Id pair with Diet Dr. Pepper or Coke Zero...
Heck yes dude this a certified banger with the lit ciggies and the chicken balls Keep em coming hoodie 
I cant fathom the fact that you think COVID is bull. Do you not understand how many people just like you whothink  COVID is bull have died and spread it. Literally almost 900
I always drink a Dr. Pepper with heavy/greasy meals.  they&#39;re called sphynx. The hairless cat.
Great story time.  Life will bring you the experiences you intend.  Trust and they will come.
I hear ya! I feel stuck too. Now that I work from home
I can totally relate to your party situations. I definitely have grown out of the sun up days. Great memories all the same.
Hoody
Same!! Fuck covid. I&#39;m grabbing my psychedelics and rubber tramping it to my next show and living my best life. You should do the same. You only get one. Well every chance I can when I&#39;m not adulting. Much love Hoody!!
One of the very nicest things about life is the way we must regularly stop whatever it is we are doing and devote our attention to eating.
Yes loving all the content
It&#39;s black hoodie I&#39;m back cooking these goodies look at these views from cooking these foods yeah...
I am a huge fan of the Coke Zero.
Great story time! I know what u mean about grieving the old life and hating the same ground hog day boring life that could come. Thats only if u let it! As u get older u evolve and grow and get new interests and find new mad shit to do! Im 43 and am grieving my 30s which were to a large degree tough but also a blessing as I had my two boys. Im looking for a new fun life now and u never know what is around the next corner. Best wishes as always from Ireland! U need to come visit here on your travels!∏èôè
I like Sprite with Chinese food. Kinda like ginger with sushi.
Hot tea
The presentation 
Try going on road trips to New places exploring.
Fire love your video&#39;s!! Bangers all week!! We&#39;re living for this!! 
Just because you get older doesnt mean you have to grow up. Everything is good in moderation. I can be a low key mom and I can be a hot mess with my friends. Its about balance. Seriously though
Yeah
Welcome to adulthood . . .  We&#39;ll handle you with care . . . promise!ã
HOODY
Loving all these videos Å
I wish every video was a storytime!
I totally feel you. The spontaneous wild nights are so damn fun and remind you that youre alive. its such a weird shift
Oh heck ya! Hoodies back with the story times. Getting some good sleep tonight for sure!
Uh oh
As a married woman
I think when you start dating again
IT&#39;S BLACK HOODY HE&#39;S BACK COOKIN&#39; THESE GOODIES

Taco Time Man... Taco Time!!!!!!!!
Taco time is the best
Yay!!Taco Timeç
Is it just me
Stop smacking ur food loud
1:13 Ayo?
TacoTime is sooooo much better then Taco Bell
Valentina is good
You&#39;re missing not using one of their new buffalo sauces
The tacos looked great! Nice video! Ø
What Taco Bell he go to the tacos and burritos he has look better than the ones here at dallas
Can u do a ghost story mukbang
Hoodyhouse long time subbie here. I used to eat valentina i can&#39;t mess with her anymore. She messes your girl stomach up big time. But every now and then I&#39;ll get a bottle. But I&#39;m in love tiger sauce that shit is bussin. Love you bro. Keep t
another banger !
You make me wanna eat tacos now
I love taco bell
Omg looks much better than Taco Bell. Happy Thanksgiving 
I am a Taco Bel whore! This looks amazing. Those hard shell tacos giving me feels! Great colors too!
Taco time  the ok corral. 
I swear once I tried Valentina on my tacos it was a love that will be eternal... 
In N Out gets swamped all day everyday
You gotta bring ASMR back
Is this at your new place or your sisters?  I prefer your mukbangs inside. Not crazy about car Mukbangs. Cant appreciate the food as well.
I feel like you&#39;ve really mastered the hard shell biteç
I dont know about Canada
If we had taco time here I&#39;d choose that over taco bell any day.
I was craving Taco John&#39;s for dinner &amp; I hadn&#39;t watched your video yet so here I am enjoying my dinner with you Hoody &amp; thanks for reminding me when you broke out the Valentina I had almost forgotten to put some Verde Salsa with my burritos &amp; it is heavenly.
Oh man 
Good eats Hoddie!
Oh my Hoody's taco time is is the bombski
Wait why is a potentially all female staff being questioned as being illegal?! Its way more frequent to enter all male staff workplaces but thats more common so apparently they dont bring up gender diversity concerns but an all female staff does...? love ur vids Hoody but that was off
Yum!
Their sour cream game hella stronger than taco bell....this looks so damn good
Hoody your the best I just love u
I just want to let you know that every time I eat Taco Bell now
Looks good! no Taco Bell so sad. I wonder if you can buy their Taco Bell sauce at the store?
Funny
Nothing wrong with an all female staff Maybe
I been to taco time they have in  Washington state so good better than taco Bell
Nice and saucy just like you
Is Hoody&#39;s location a closely guarded secret? I somehow got it in my head that he&#39;s in Hamilton
We used to have a Taco Time in Fargo...I loved it...Now I go to the Peg to get it....you always make the food look soooo yummy...é
I see you got your mic
Taco Bell got rid of their Mexican pizza
Loves yummy
Another great video from the Canadian food enthusiast 
Damn that looks good it looks better then Taco bell just saying and baja blast is life.
Those who have had both:Taco Bell or Taco Time?
I wish they had a taco time in mississauga
Authentic Mexican is way better
haven&#39;t had Taco Time in years way better than taco bell
There&#39;s a Taco Bell in  Sault ste. Marie.
Chicken ranch is 
YASSSSSS this was a good video. I like when you add the sour cream and valentino....mannnn......
we need taco time in the states taco bell sucks
The 1 dislike on this video was never hugged as a child
Bro this looks way better then Taco Bell  &amp; Taco Bell is my absolute fav! Hopefully someday I can try it 
Long John Silver&#39;s was my first job at 16 and every Friday during lent we would get hit hard. I mean a double line around the drive through
Happy Thanksgiving.
Happy thanksgiving bro! Those burritos are the perfect ratio man! Looks great. 
Valentina is the best hot sauce!

That&#39;s a cheesy Brazilian bread.  It&#39;s super popular and a favorite for many.  I like having one
45 dollars is so cheap for all that wow
Oh god
Who taught this guy how to eatMan definitely needs slapped for chewing like that Am I the only 1 who wants to jump thru this screen and pop him for chewing like that Man he definitely eat corn on the cob long ways
High
just gonna take a bite of it first&quot;<b>proceeds to eat 80%
Grew up in New Mexico very used to those heavily flavored cuts
I love watching these types of vids
does anyone else notice how he eats the brittle?
pretty sure that beef one is Picana
For some reason i always come back to this video and his KFC vs Korean fried chicken video
such a deal
omg im so hungry now
had me wheezing icl
The bread looks like a very popular cheese bread in Brazil
Their lamb chops are probably the best thing they have
constipation
No one BenDeen: Mighty fine
Damn homie go full before he was done
So happy that you are having some traditional brazilian food. For sure you will like our sweet food as well. I personally always see good ratings when foreigners try brazilian sweet food;
Lamb is gamey which gives it a bitter taste and I really enjoy it with mint jelly because it helps cut through that and adds a freshness to it without being too sweet
Reminds me of Fogo d chao
Jesus loves u. 
&quot;I&#39;m just going to take a bite of it first.&quot; ::BitesHoleIntoTheStratosphere::
Please don&#39;t ever become a zombie.
Texas de Brazil should pay you for this! Everything looks delicious.
when he said &quot;that little paper-looking bacone&quot; I felt that
Texas de Brazil in Michigan too and oh man its good. The waiters/waitresses just walk around with racks of meat and come by your table and drop off whatever you want. Ohhh man
&quot;i&#39;m just gonna take a bite of it first&quot;almost eats his fingers
U talk too much
love your videos
Tex sausage got that snap my friend. Dang ol brisket is the best though.
my man got confused with the pao de queijo. That&#39;s a bread with cheese in it&#39;s dough
Wish you&#39;d eat the salads
Yo why did he attack those slices of meat like that lol
Dude gotta smack on it like its about to run about from him. Almost aggravating to me cause its so unnecessary like bro just eat the damn food like a normal person stop smacking on it like its about to escape from you.
Those are beef ribs brother.  Lol Could you imagine the size of the pig that would have that big of a flat rib.
$45 seems like the best deal ever
How do you chew 2 times and swallow a whole slab of meat?
 so that&#39;s picanha
I went to a steak house in brazil and had this exact same reaction and experience to the different foods
top ribs in your life? you sure? I&#39;ve been there many times it has a gamey smell
Spent 2 days feeling the aftermath of Texas de Brazil. Pretty good. Fun environment
im gonna just take a bite of it first eats the entire slice
Ravenous - Hilarious
I wont ever eat with this guy if had to I wont have for me
BenDeen one of my favourite human.
bro when I saw you was about to try some brazilian food I had to check it out
Wow this is crazy
I&#39;ve never been to Texas de Brazil because I heard they serve alot of different ummm....animals.
idk how to describe it im thinkingggg NOM
Aww yes this sounds like Chama Brazilian Steakhouse... sooooo amazingly good and worth the money!!
literally whispered &#39;dip it in the sauce&#39; when he made the little sarnie haha
I&#39;m going to take a little bite of it  eats 60% of it in 0.5 seconds
Brasil record more Brazilian food.
Share us some
We dont eat Chimichurri with barbecue in Texas soooooo. I dont know what that is. TEXAS barbecue in bomb. Our governor is trash but out barbecue is bomb!!!!
He doesn&#39;t chew much that&#39;s for sure. It would take hour ro so for me to finish this.
Funny how the chicken breast is literally a perfect representation
The cheese bread is called p√o de queijo ! We mix mozzarella cheese In the batter which gives it the chewy texture 
Who would eat that after touching it so many times with your bare hands
Nausea
Texas Barbecue from Texas is better than Brazil just saying.
this just made me drop 80$ on uber for bbq. I was only at 0:50
Lol pork belly is pretty damn popular and very southern bbq
just take a bite proceeds to make the meat dissapear
Brazilian steakhouses are almost flawless.  More than you can say for other restaurants.  The crowded area is the only downfall really...
Everytime he want to dip it in sauce uncontrollably he eats the whole thing without dipping
He is a competitive eater
I know he scarfed the rest of that down as soon as the video ended he aint slick Lmao
The guy we&#39;ll get along very well at the cookout no meat left on the bone mad respect he almost chewed off the Gristle
Those ribs sound so tough.
Ben dosent know what meat he&#39;s eating
This guy doesn&#39;t even chew he just tears and swallows
God dammit he didnt get the potato au gratin
Im excited to go this weekend. Thanks for the review! Looks like Im going to be screaming for the ribs and Picanha and avoiding the chicken lol.
this whole video Ben is taking a bite and getting suprised at everything
Those sausages and bacon wrap steak was my favorite and scallop potatoes at the restaurant its so good 
I get drunk and watch these videos
Loud af slop chewing
He takes long to start eating but when he does he is so fast
Best shit ever in Crocker park Ohio
I'm just gonna take a bite of it first  jesus christ
The circular cut is picanha (top sirloin) the one you referred to as brisket is flank stake or skirt stake. Only coated in rock salt and cooked over charcoal. I manage a Texas de Brazil !
I&#39;m going here tonight for my brother&#39;s birthday and this has me so excited for it.
Im sure you know of Raina Hung. Not sure of her last name. She lives in L A. Im almost sure she went to a place like youre mentioning. They come around to the tables with the meat and the biscuits etc. I would never have thought you could do delivery at that type of place. Boy did you make me hungry!
Jesus loves you  
i really shouldn&#39;t be watching this at 2am
l am from Brazil
For some reason its hard to watch him eat all that food without something to drink
Just had Texas de Brazil for the first  time on August 19 it was bussin Ø
Man when he eats ribs. HE EATS THEM GOOD
Ben Deen is that dude
You should play the guitar
He ate the fuck out them ribs

Oh my goodness Rico I am trying to cut out meet BUTTT!!! I  would so get my teeth into this curry goat roti...
Who else likes them a big ole STEAK?!
Yesss Colombia
Omg so happy you tried colombian food
Try eating the arepa w butter or mix it w a little bit of rice &amp; beans
that was big bite of yuca
I enjoyed this classic meal as i catch up. mmmyummy.  the sounds the description
dipped in chimichurri sauce  that was a 1st for sure! We typically have it with coffee. Glad you liked our food!
Just came across this video. I&#39;m Colombian and this really made my day. The sauces-- chimi for the steak
The steak seems a bit chewy.
Blood!!!
Yum!
You did not just dip the pandebono in the chimichurri sauce 
GOD forbids the consumption of blood that&#39;s why the satanists are so obsessed with it! This is part of the end times rebellion against GOD&#39;S laws. Acts 15 is about whether the Gentiles should obey this law (prohibition on eating blood) or not. Then verses 22ì29 state: &quot;For it has seemed good to the Holy Spirit and to us not to put any greater burden on you than these necessary things: to contain you from idol sacrifices and blood and from suffocations and fornication&quot; ( see v. 19-20). This clearly shows that the ban on eating blood is still absolutely valid for us Christians today.  So please repent and give your life to JESUS CHRIST now
Thanks  for  this video i love you from  Colombia
&quot;blood sausage&quot; ? Why is it called like that? Don&#39;t tell me it&#39;s raw?
That steak looks super under cooked
Wow! I&#39;m Colombian
Morcilla it&#39;s more like black pudding not sausage
you should try the arepa w butter
Ok I am not Colombian but my mum is and I love Colombian food and also u can eat arepa with absolutely anything arepa is made out of wheat I think
I&#39;m from England and we call blood sausage Black pudding x
Im Colombian and this pissed me off for some Reason≠(No hate)
Seriously why can&#39;t I ever find a guy to date that has his taste buds. Open to trying anything and love foreign flavors. Not just American food.
Can you  from the Dominican Republic
You need to try the salchichapapa coste
Dieing for you to do Puerto Rican food
I can&#39;t believe you ate all that lol
bro im just catching up on few of your older videos thats how i found this gem and if you like these kind of food you def need to hit up a cuban spot i&#39;d love to see that
I was drooling while you were eating that steak. Just the sounds of chewing made my mouth water..Great video. Part of my catch up tour to watch your vids!
I feel appreciated that your trying our food 
Si supiera como hacen la morcilla jajaja es impresionante pero deliciosa
Craving this at 4am I can't wait till 9am to order lolll
Colombian food is so good
Did he just call Quang Tran q Chong ?
I love it all except that blood sausage would not touch my lips.
Come to Houston my mom will make you a seriously lit Colombian feast
Wow I can&#39;t wait for southern italian food mukbang!!! It&#39;s one of the best foods out there for me. (Please no spaghetti and meatballs
Dont worry mikey iam a black south African man we don&#39;t use knife and fork to eat meat  we use our so feel free
Also you should try corozo and maracuya juice
Next time you should try from colombia: cazuela de mariscos
I&#39;m a colombian and tbh arepas and pastel de yuca hit that comfort spot all the time.
Love steak anyway I can get it!  Everything looks delicious!  I have never had blood sausage.. love to try the Chimichurri
 YOU SHOULD TRY VENEZUELAN FOOD
Bloody love steak!! ããã and awww blood sausage
Wow !!! 
The actual empanada is potatoes!!!! W meat insideeeeee and yessss is one of my favoriteeeees empanadas toooooo!!!
Lmaoooo pan de bono is a sweet dish lmao when u dipped in the chimichurri I laughed sooooo HARD
Omggggg tryyy Ecuadorian food!!! Encebollado
You literally did nothing wrong. you ate all this food perfectly omg.
I eat Colombian food everyday and its the best thing ever
Im Colombian. I love the food its sooo gooodddd. the blood sausage is my least favorite. When I was smaller I saw how they made it and now I wont even eat it lol
That clip of Quang has me rolling
you enjoy it more when you eat it w your hands lol. at least thats what some korean chef saidÖ i love it.
Unfortunately they did not sell you the traditionally Colombian
I am really happy
Hey mikey why you dont try the food from my contry Dominican Republic?
I do like Colombian food btw Im not Colombian but I dont like steak that much to be honest thats just me though I would have ate everything probably except the steak only way I will eat it is if its well done and not too fatty
Colombia is in the house 
You should really try Peruvian food!!

Haha something about an assistantù IYKYK Ö
Ah don&#39;t be tricking your followers

After telling the owners its really nice!!telling them 3 times I think they get the message just eat we all can see the legs are big &amp;tasty get it done &amp;dusted son!!! Uk posse in the houseÖ
Stop talking geezer &amp;eat
Joel
Luv it luv it u b doing datÅ
Your assistant is hot!!
Joel
Joel your new assistant is fyre 
Joel looks like he is having the Itis while eating
I see why you dont do a lot of challenges with rice! I know you wish you had an assistant to help you out bud
Joel
Joel I love watching you .That meal looked so yummy . I have been watching you for a long time . I think sometimes wow I don&#39;t know where you put it all. 
You talk to much in all your videos. I know you enjoy it but you repeat yourself
I volunteer as your assistant when yoou come to nebraska!
You should definitely consider trying Ethiopian food next.
You were full
The jalof looked yummy....
Love to be your assistant sometime soon!
Have a great day
Joel it was great to meet your new assistant.
It all looks amazing
Lamb Vindaloo
That food looked so delicious. That was enough food for both you and your assistant.
Well after seeing you eat Im craving some Egusi Soup and Fufuã
Hi Joel
Seems like he thought the wings would be Buffaloù type and not drumsticks. Hes never seen a true drum stick.The tiny wings you eat are BABIES!!!
Your assistant is HOT! Didnt expect that....
Love the way Joel is under the clock and he&#39;s just casually eating and talking. He has 50th gear in reserve.
I have had legs from a home grown 
Joel it was great meeting your assistant.
Your assistant is hot 
I am from Thailand
How do you pick a restaurant
Joe thank you for being I would like to know more about how you pick
Im impressed with how much water you drink each video. I dont even drink that much in a day lol
I can&#39;t eat anything you&#39;re eating because I am highly allergic to tomatoes
Joel
First time seeing Joel struggle w finishing I think
The best assistant
I need them sweet plantains
It looks good
Your assistant did a great job considering she was barely in the video
I was so awesome to meet your beautiful assistant
I dont know how you do it. Are you sick in stomach
Well done
Great to meet ur new assistant
It was so nice meeting ur assistant
I always watch your videos all the way through even if I dont see your new assistant. Lol.
Joel it was GREAT to meet you and your new assistant!!! Ive been watching your channel for hours
Looks really yummy 
New assistant is spicy bro
Rice is deceiving filling once you get full it continues to expand. And bananas and plantains they look small but are supremely filling. The fact Joel did this challenge blows my mind. He ate but prob felt like ate it twice in a hr after.
Im not huge rice fan I had few I like but most are to me are bland and flavorless. But Im gonna look up recipes for that rice cause that looks awesome.
Joel you look like you could use an assistant!
Way way hotter than regular food
I would need to have an assistant to eat all of that food.
Joel i know your assistant
Nice assistant !
I would have been insulted if I owned that restaurant after having seen this video where you say you ate before coming there
SO fine
I don&#39;t know how u can do it 
That looks so good
So happy to see your new assistant. I know youve been looking for one!
Great to meet your new assistantç∏è The food looks amazing!
your the king man that was enough rice for 20 people
no need for a food assistant! just eat eat eat eat eat eat eat eat
Great video! Not sure if I like the new format where you have an assistant pre-chew the food for you
Did not look like you enjoyed
Was great to meet your new assistant !!!!!!

Haha I have been craaaving Italian food lately so I decided to go with some of my favorites to celebrate the Magic Gang hitting 70
I need more vids like this
I dont see many Italian mukbangs glad you did one !!
Buco is not authentic Italian.
Man i really wish I could eat like you do!
That chocolate cake though!
Your so handsome
You made me hungry
I want all of that! That cake
This guys likes food and sports. He says it bring us together.  Keep living the real life bro and understand its not that simple.
The food looks cold
You can probably assume that all food in the US that&#39;s supposed to be from a different country has been &quot;americanized&quot; up to the point where the accuracy of the origin is about 5% left.
More Italian food!!!! Pleaseee
The chocolate cake reminded me of bruce bogtrotter
That&#39;s nothing but American bullshit food. Nothing to do with Italian food
Weirdest food would have to be escargot ê in Paris
More Italian food please
Spaghetti looks dry but still looks good
Wow food looks epic. You gotta do Italian more often and more Greek too!!!!
Stop calling this Rubbish Fake American-Pseudo what ever...Italo Food as &#39;&#39;Italian&#39;&#39; ! It&#39;s not ! To cook REAL Italian Food
the weirdest food ive ever eaten is alligator lol
Omg watching this on my fast day ≠Åù looks sooo good 
I&#39;m Italian and no there is no chicken parm haha
your the best on youtube magic mikey
Just found you and watched like 10 of your videos
the first bite of the cake had me gone. lmao
U eat like youve never ate before but yum
he eats the way i wish i could eat
You should try having a small bowl or plate for mukbangs like some Korean mukbangers. Keeps things neat
Wow!! Wish we had this venue of italian!     Please consider a whole cake from that restaurant!
From an Italian near nyc that is definitely looking like the worst Italian food Ive ever seen Im sorry lol ê
I would love to see you eat hot food at home one time lol
You eat like my 3 year old cousin
I love your smile kind one
Youre such a sweetheart!  I have been craving Italian lately and you just gave me my dinner inspiration.  Å  That chocolate cake?  That pushed me over the edge
Local Italian restaurants vs chain Italian restaurants
This doesnt look so italian to me.... You should come here and try
Man
That cake looks like the big slab of cake out of the film Matilda lol 
My Italian heart is shook
Sorry to say you mek too much mass

Sinceramente non ce proprio niente di italiano Ö
I love that giant double fudge chocolate cake! And yesterday I had my best ever bowl of spaghetti: al dente
Dessert is always last 
Omg Mike...I love pasta its my favorite...especially lasagna yummmmmmmmm...and if you like spicy food try Nigerian food or Ethiopian food..if u can handle that spice I will give you a straight up 10/10.....hahaaa
Ehmmmmmm..... where is italian food???
Chicken parm is not Italian
Pasta&#39;s look dry as hell.
Fettuccine Alfredo is ALWAYS my go to. YUM
You are supposed to twirl the speghetti on the spoon with the fork  That&#39;s how Italians do it
Lol alll those dishes are huge they only serve family style
<b>PASTA!
Eating pasta with bread italians exited the video
Mikey a.k.a. The KING of youtube mukbangers

thats looks awesome tasty 
All I can say is wow
This was a pure setup
One Rib and you need a wipe and a drink.?????Just please go to that hole
Easy
They wrong for that shit. They known you can win if they cooked it right
is Kilo Crew in the background  lol
gaming adds ...lost for words
The food in London always looks gross. Just say it Joe.
Great advertising for a resto in a country
Ive watched like 30 to 40 videos naw this man is a beast
Nice
Yeah
You need a British beeer
Wow!
I can hear Scott&#39;s voice somewhere doing his own challenge
They honestly do not know how to cook their meat properly or they do it on purpose to make it harder for the challenge
The best barbeque ribs is in Texas
UK cannot cook ribs tthe right jummy way
You did say Compliments to the shelf lolÖ
Im a messy rib eater. You cant help it.
This was HANDS DOWN A BAD RESTAURANT!! I remember Joel saying
I think they need to send that cook to Texas to relearn how to smoke ribs they looked burnt The slaw looked good and fries but this ribs oh man pretty rough.
&quot;Interesting flavor&quot;
Should of worn your gloves
They should have given you a knife lol Ive def had some ribs like that even in the US lowkey annoys me and Im not even an eating challenge competitor. èΩçô∏è≠
They burned those ribs on purpose ®
That looked nasty
No jerky ribs 
I thought he was using toughest to describe the challenge turned out he was talking about those beef jerky tough a$$ ribs.
Happy birthday big guy
i probably won&#39;t take that challenge if it wasnt poured by Carolina DarkyRed sauce
Joel is extremely polite and clearly those ribs were not cooked properly.  Good job on a tough task!
Omg! Those ribs are off the hook! ù
&quot;Its like beef jerky&quot; huh  not the ribs
those morons
Thanks I know where not to eat when in London
First time a video has not made me hungry.
You can tell by the color of the bones that they are either old ribs and recooked to order or kept in an oven/heater all day and dried out.
Aka this bbq sucks
Food looked terrible
Well the ribs probably had too much sugar high heat makes them crusty burnt almost sugar glaze get very hard I&#39;m a chef those look like crap sorry u had to go through  that they should be embarrassed good luck you&#39;re great
The sauce &quot;didn&#39;t taste bad
Ummm it looked like those ribs didnt want to come off the bone ! I think the reason its undefeated because the meat is so tough
Those ribs seemed tougher than leather.
Joel we do not eat ribs in the uk like that theyve definitely just over cooked them for the challenge because we dont eat our ribs like that well I dont
Looks delicious
They burnt your ribs man.
Poor Joel
If you think thats a lot of sauce I have to wonder if youve ever had riblets at Applebees 
Makes you wonder how long those ribs had been baking
Apologies for that particular ribs is your first experience in UK. I know you will be invited to sample ribs across the UK you will find they look and taste nice
Definitely not from Texas
Thank u for being a gentleman
In the UK this is normal!!!!  And it expensive!   How sad for the UK people.
Really  joel
So sorry your first time of eating ribs
Those werent Texas ribs! Lol . I wouldnt eat them
Leave it to Americans to cook BBQ. Lol
That doesn&#39;t even look like it tastes good.  I know the UK has some pretty bad food...but YIKES.
They look extremely over cooked.  Rock on Joel.  Ribs should be tender and moist.
I&#39;ve never heard a good review of &#39;man v food london&#39;
Joel you talk too much during the challenges. You waste eating time . We watch to see you eat
Like who the hell would pay for that?
Am I the only one who roots for the food to win every time?
Old ribs Bro but good job
Lol. I felt for u buds! That did not look like fun......and you know how to make over eating look good! Anyways..... well done for seeing it through and not being a doosh by dissing the joint
Looks terrible
Thats kind of weird to me as a restaurant that they would want to put their ribs out there in the world all tough and chewy
those ribs were just bad. just seeing how you had to tear them off the bone it prolly means they were just burned. if you dont wana say it
Them ribs probably three days old
How does it all fit in your stomach
Props to you bro. I love ribs but those look like shit. Sorry man. Keep going! You got this!
American style bbq in BritainJoel say it aint so. Go with the local eats: shepherds pie
Titled toughestù for more than one reason haha
Crap ribs in a contest....  I&#39;ll pass .Good stuff bud.
Looks terrible
Hey love  watching you you are so handsome
What a terrible challenge
I haven&#39;t heard you use the word amazing at all
Uk ribs arent usually like that. They fall off the bone. Not sure what happened there.
You cook ribs low and slow not blast them in the oven and turn it to charcoal.
HELLOOOOOO family.
It was cooked improperly lol
That is very poor cooking you can get better in the UK.
There are much better ribs out there in the UK. They have made the ribs hard and tough to slow you down. Not all ribs are like this!
Its sad to see youve had over cooked ribs
Am from va but living in the uk but the food is not the same and its a different flavor
Maybe the difficulty of the challenge is because of the way the meat is cooked. It&#39;s not fall off the bone which is what it should be and I imagine that is totally messed up it isn&#39;t.
No compliments to the chef after that burp.. not surprisingly
Brits not knowing how to cook ribs properly
You Rock Joel
"Love your videos! Wow sure seems like they want ppl to fail this challenge by making it that difficult <a href=""https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ms4IKJWo35k&amp;t=469"">7:49</a>"
JOEL BABY I WOULD. HAVE WENT BACK TO WHERE EVER I WAS SLEEPING YOUR TRULY POLITE EXTREMELY SIRRRRR I KNOW CONTENT U WANTED TO GETTING IT DONE BUT THAT WAS JUST JEFKYùóùóùóùóùóùóùóùóùóPS JOEL SIRRRRR WHEN U BURPPPPP PLZ DON&#39;T COMPLEMENTS TO THE CHEF BABY JUST CUT THE CAMERA OFF.......

Yummy Joel
Ok joel 
I am wondering if you ever did a menu challenge at Chik-fil-a.  Its a southern US chain.  The tenders look like a similar breading.
Joel should always tale the name of the place he&#39;s eating at the end of the videos.
That food looks AMAZING!!!
Joel
I love these videos without time limits. Love the reviews of the food. I want that chicken!
I cannot!
&quot;So tempting food&quot;..
In my city
I want to make a funny meme out of your fast motion chewing with you as a squirrel.
Food looked great... again i could only eat 2/3 of one. Something was up w your hair this time. Different stylist?
Ive never been interested in having a deep fried Mars bar until now. Im keeping a list of places that you visit for when I finally get overseas. I just love your appreciation of food.
This food was amazing to see you consume! It was all prepared perfectly
How much is your average bill when you eat out like this?.
30 seconds in and my mouth is already watering ...
See I can see that that was too much food I don&#39;t think anyone who offers a food challenge should make the eater look bad wouldn&#39;t you rather have him enjoying and complementing your food which he&#39;s  doing as best he can without looking bad. remember he&#39;s advertising your food.
They should make it a challenge after you now!!
Kasla hantoy full dabun....
That food looks Amazing. YUM
Where the hell do you put it.... absolute legend. Love your content pal
Wow! Everything looks so delicious!
Damn man that looks so incredibly deliciously mouth watering good
Next time I&#39;m in KW I&#39;m going to stop here. Won&#39;t be spending $200+ though lol.
Hope you joy your 11LB great burger and your fried chicken platter my son Joel 
Nice
How much did that cost Joel ? I think the mushroom burger was my fav
I know this was a year ago
There is just something about seeing a man like Joel enjoying his food.......swoon
Another great job Joel! So much food and you make every bite look so delicious!
I miss seeing the timer
Looks so yummy everything down to deserts look amazing.
Looks delicious
Should have been a time limit on this one less talking.
I don&#39;t know how you fit it all in but God it looks so good.
Hi Joel how are you?I recently saw your channel and I was amazed how you do these challenges.What got you started doing these challenges
It would be so nice if that restaurant came to America especially around West Hartford Connecticut Hartford Connecticut Manchester Connecticut that would blow over so well over here and have one on the UConn campus UMass Wesleyan college area you made my mouth water just watching you eat all those burgers and chicken sandwiches and milkshakes and chocolate chip cookie oh my God and the deep fried Mars bar never ever had a deep fry candy bar my hiney doesn&#39;t need it but my mouth says oh what the heck you only live once and it&#39;s not often so why not go for it at least once thank you so much Joel for sharing Please Continue To Stay Safe Healthy Strong and Happy Many Blessings and Much Love-n-Peace∏èØáôèèæôù∏è
Wow
I want some! Dang

Lovely ketchup...
Well i just cant wait to see you eat all this stuff and watch you till you are done i love watching you every day.
Y you&#39;re good at food challenges and good looking
I meant to tell you in that other vid that I saw of you talking about how you ate that burger that was still cold and disgustingly stringy bring your own scale make sure you have a contract first and most of all to make sure of the weight and the product and bring yourself a nice strong State knife of your own and cut all your sandwiches and chicken and all meat products open to make sure that it&#39;s well cooked because eating raw chicken can kill you and the way certain ground beef is it can really make you sick so these are some good tips first number one again contract with pictures and wait and everything of the food cut everything open before you put anything in your mouth because God forbid if you get sick and die behind someone&#39;s ugliness by making sure that you don&#39;t have well cooked chicken OMG please protect yourself I wish you nothing but the best of health handsome many blessings and much love and peace∏è áôèèæªØù∏è

Hello first time I&#39;m comment on video but I want to know all that food you eat much do you workout because you eat a lot of food and you so fit and handsome  I  might say and like your eating video I just be to scare to comment on them
I have something called &quot;Alpha Gal&quot; and basically
Looks delicious but again... WHERE DOES HE PUT IT ALL? 
You know when ever you get full
How many hungry people could be fed with what you just ate? Well... I guess as long as you get your advertisement money... is all good.

U mind if I join you sometime
All u eat  u still looking good!!!!
Joel you are a BEAST
Ey Joel
Love thai
Everything is getting cold!  Shhhh!!  Eat!!
OML!  Just watching the intro
I&#39;m eating a giant container of cottage cheese while I watch this... I only wanted a few bites but we&#39;re past that now
I love watching u eat and ur commentary
Joel probably just me but it drives me crazy when you hold things up close to the camera because half the time it falls off the fork or plate. We can see if its juicy or whatever youre trying to convey if not visually just by your facial expressions or narrative. Ö∏è
Joel you probably cant answer this question but what are your top five food challenges based on the flavor and quality of the food.
Its like the difference between McDonalds and a real hamburger.
One of the best!
Panang Curry...my absolute favØriteº∏è It&#39;s the lemongrass for me..ã
That blue rice is spectacular! I&#39;ve never heard of it or seen it! I&#39;ve never had Tai food so I am putting this on my must try list! Thank you Joel for taking us along with you!ùçΩ
why does the food you get always look amazing and the stuff always look shit from a takeaway in the UK around the Sheffield area lol
My opinion of a Thai restaurant is all depending on the Pad Thai.  LOVE me some good Pad Thai!!!
Joel
Thank you for stopping by Farmhouse Kitchen - chef Kasem &lt;3
I can&#39;t belive how much you eat and how lean you look.  Amazing
Awesome video. Best looking dish I&#39;ve ever seen in my life
All this food looks delicious!!!
Looks like normal portion
So nice to see you enjoying yourself Joel.
This is a walk in the park for you. Nice to see a get one of those once in awhile:-)
So pretty 
My late brother in law made something his full-blooded Thai Mom makes called beef salad... I highly recommend it... But also would LOVE the recipe
Awsome dishes Joel
You make it look too easy.
Im so hungry right now.

He said he will never tell. We know that its Michelle.

Quick question
Why u shakin???
That&#39;s my favorite hot sauce
 is when he starts eating
starts to eat  yes love messy eating ù
Wow! You did all that cooking but you didn&#39;t fry up some corn tortillas. Why not?
You need that black label Valentina
You are so relaxing
Damn I want tacos now
Now I want tacos new follower
I love tacos
Dude eat n peace n stop talking sm still ù your vidsÖ
You talk to much people watch this to see you eat not talk please be quiet and just finish smdh.
Back to one of my fav videos from yu...miss you. Pray all is well..
Damn
You talk too much! Eat the dang taco please lol
I need some of your Tacos right now before I go to work tonight
Taco&#39;s are my favorite food.  I could eat them 7 days a week.  Taco! Taco! Taco!
Love this
Yummy
Why do you put sour cream on your tacos? That's like putting salt and pepper on ice cream
Those look so freaking good! I made tacos one time and with Habs and Ghosts. My ex cried but couldn&#39;t stop eating them. She said they were so hot but by far the best tacos she has ever had in her life. She hates me these days but still says they were the best ever.
My First video !! I just subscribed !!!
Your channel is the best . Just subscribed. 100k soon
can you send me some plzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
Eating starts at 20:47
They are beautifully done! 
his intro is so cringe
Perfect
Is that cup from waffle house?
I love how you use a hand towel and not paper towels to wipe your hands and mouth 
Cooking seems to be a very therapeutic hobby for you and I can just tell its a really good thing for you. Keep your head up and keep doing what your doing dude.
They look so good
I like you. You are cool
My god. Shut up
I bet one of those wide shells is like 2 regular shells.
Yeas lawd!
The perfect layering technique for the sour cream lovers is thisMeatSour cream Lettuce Tomato or salsa Cheese Sour cream
These look delicious
Omg  I'm new here my friend those tacos looks amazing
lol! I think that it&#39;s weird that you used tongs to handle the beef! I think that most people would use a spatula! XD
I want to reach through my phone
I'm hungry dude
I found you bro love your videos
 the best life pro tips comes when you least expect it!! Thumbs up for that alone.
Yes; I'm my house we eat tacos like 6 times a month or more..You did that
Incredible Look tacos Mouth watering. As always enjoy you Vids
Those tacos look good
I like putting my lettuce in first so it soaks up everything else and my shell won't get soggy too quick
Too much chatter and hands. But the tacos tho. DELISH. And I&#39;m steeling the peperoncini juice idea. Never thought of it. I do use ketchup too. And I&#39;ve never used an emersion blender on meat before. Thanks for the heads up.
Especially that the  word
Don't say the n word bro ur not black Foreal though
I&#39;m new to the channel and just got to say those tacos look bomb. I love loaded tacos
You should make homemade cheesy gordita crunches
Your fire man!!! Love your cooking
Those tacos look delicious
I really love your food is so saucy
That cheese tip
Yo Whats that thing you used to help with the meat consistency??
The tacos looked mad tasty! Nice video!
BEEN WATCHING HIM FOR A COUPLE YEARS AND YO YOU GUYS SHOULD HELP GET HIM TO 100K! ôèLove the video and the tacos damn I want 10!
the best construction for a taco is pretty simple get a tortilla wrap heat it up with a tortilla shell put sour cream on the wrap with a spoon and use it to stick the wrap around the shell like a glue then add meat sauce sour cream vegetables then lettuce on top and tweak to personal preference
I don&#39;t get it 15 unlikes what&#39;s there to unlike ?
So Good
Hey man in next video can you eat three hot dogs??
Blending the meat is kinda weird
Very satisfied
I like u
Yes to the Valentina hot sauce
absolutely amazing video contenthave a blessed day
Can you do a huge bowl of your favourite soup!!!!
They look so good!!!
Wish ASMRs would shut up and eat
Just found your channel and I am a new subscriber ùù I will be watching your old videos happy I found your channel
There is nothing
I am glad to be back. I&#39;ve been dealing with some personal shit and I haven&#39;t been by. I will binge watch soon. The tacos look super delicious! 
I season my taco meat exactly like you except I add a punch of cinnamon I know sound crazy but super good just a pinch and that was an awesome hack  to blend it  with a hand blender looked awesome
I love your taco videos
I literally just had tacos and tried Valentina for the first time and im addicted now!! It&#39;s like 90 cents a bottle here lol
Best tacos I&#39;ve ever seen in my life.
Yum! Could definitely get down with those tacos!
Dude must hv forgotten his mic
I must make tacos tomorrow!! Thumbnail is awesome!
I find if you place a bit of shredded cheese on the bottom first
Do they have squeeze sour cream in Canada or are we just blessed in the US? Seeing you make that whole squeeze bag and I&#39;m like wait they make that 
I bet that pepperoncini juice hit in that taco meat. Also
I have the perfect taco layering ! They always look bomb and are effective when eating. Ok it is -crunchy shell of course. Then lettuce this is key!!! Then the meat. Then cheese to melt on the meat. Then I use nacho cheese also. Optional. Then I add pico
Hi! New subscriber here! I am so glad that i came across your channel! You nade ny #1 favorite meal
Amazing tacos Hoody.  Thanks for the kitchen hacks.  Did not know the cheese one.
That would feed a family of 6. Did look lovely though
Messed up
That burrito is bussin
Looks like a tray full of odd color pudding.
Ive noticed he doesnt really attempt to be entertaining and Ive never heard him crack a joke
There is. A terrible backgroundnoisecantlisten to thevido
Good job
Would have to say I&#39;ve watched alotof ur videos and this was the first one I&#39;d say where the food looked and seemed gross
Love that Burrito
That thing is the size of large log. Can't believe you got this done in such a short time. Man your good
Wow
The music sounds like it came out of the OG Final Fantasy 7
I wish I had your job
Is that the mugshot bar and grill shirt from wasilla alaska??
Joe saying something is spicey... after we seen this guy eat hot sauce like ketchup with his food. Lol.
That burrito would last me half the week!
Wow  you demolished it Joel
Absolutely love a good wet burrito.  I just can&#39;t mess with the spicy stuff. My digestive system is a mess.
No
Nice video but I know Randy Santel would of cleaned the whole plate. Jus saying
Rip ur toilet
Great I love watching your videos
That was a great challenge
Talk to much
Joel &quot;the jack hammer&quot; Hansen destroys another challenge.
Bro change that back screen when your shirt is off. It&#39;s not appealing u get more views
It would be great if you add the videos of making process in high speed before  start to eat every time . Cheers
Joel&#39;s stomach: OH C&#39;MON
The toilet must've required multiple flushes
All that without getting hardly any on your beard and none on your shirt! I would have failed in the first couple bites lol. Well done Sir!
Nice
Please stop with the goofy face thumbnails
Very very very large
Nice music!
Omg u so close to where I stay wish I can catch a challenge up close that would give me so much life
Is it just me but am I the only who think they could destroy that burrito but in reality.
Joel
Anyone ever watch one of these videos and recognize the background then you find out it's in your city lol
I've seen you take down bigger burritos
Might be worth the risk of the enduring heartburn to eat that.
Lame prizesThat was at least an 8 pound burrito 
This makes me want Mexican food! Love watching your videos.
Hey Joel. Always a pleasure.. Stay killing it FR.. Happy Holidays.. 
What's the zip code of that thing ?
i beleave he would have finished in 6 minutes if it wasn&#39;t spicy
3 minutes in Joel: &quot;flavourful&quot; Advert:..... &quot;lets stop you right there&quot; Me: o_0
I swear I'm starting to think the only reason he became a professional eater was so he doesn't have to pay for a challenge
Craving a burrito now ! Good job Joel !
<b>Not sure if you enjoy horchata
GREAT JOB JOEL !!!
Yummy
I think they make it bigger for competitive eaters. I&#39;d make them weigh it lol. Looked delicious though.
Do mukabang videos you can get more views
Where is leave no doubts ?????? :D anyway Burrito looked delicious..
Wet burritos are the dumbest dish ever... they completely defeat the point of the burrito in the first place.  Might as well just throw all the ingredient on the plate and call it a day.
That one looked like it hurt
You were definitely not happy about the sauce soaking.
Lmfao the salsa verde was acidic
My pregnant self has never wanted a burrito more in my life  don&#39;t think we have anything like that burrito in Australia though
$30 is a Steal! That would last me a week!
I absolutely love wet burritos. That thing was massive! Would be a good couple days worth of food for me lol.
Your so fast when you eat! I love sauced burritos!
This is a Bulimic binge
I love spicy foods
Something you might want to check out when you&#39;re in capsaicin hell is drinking completely flat Pepsi that has been chilled. Works really well with extremely hot peppers
I hate when white people say &quot;queso cheese&quot;
Randy would say leave no doubt clean that plate more. He would lick it. Haha. It looked good though.
Maybe get an external clip on mic with a computer program to isolate the audio so dumb copy write music doesnt effect your epic videos é∏è
The OG of eating
Thats crazy I work on university in huntsville wish I knew omg
That looks delicious  good job
The red and green chile put together is called Christmas in new mexico terms
You going to be in my town ???  Plzzz
I live in Huntsville I cant believe you came here!! Wish I hadve known!
Just amazing
Fantastic
so impressive. its like some kind of tardis thing
That was a ridiculous amount of sauce you had to eat
i never seen you struggle like that brother
If your still in that area
Wow look like you had alil hard time on this one but alsum job ur the man
Sort of deflating 
Joel looks great man. Great job killing it. But can you please send a link of that audio track on the video its fire!
That is definitely the biggest burrito I have ever seen. Looks good. But how could anyone eat this entire thing in twenty minutes is insane
connoisseur.. lol... funny
Awsome job you killed it. Really was massive. Great job Joel
You need a glass at the end to get rid of all the sauce.
Time to work on your spice game Joel
Omg! Can you please just stop with all the talking?!!!! We have eyes.
Omg..that burrito looks delish
I love that place . I miss living in Alabama and eating there .
Hello Joel Hanson you really Rock i hope to see you here in Royal Oak they&#39;re is several restaurants out here by me tell me what kinda food do you like
How can you do this? Ten of us could eat this
Damn that was a big burritoI love my Mexican food but that would be the end of me if I ate that much food.Good job Joel
That burrito looks like one I want to try 
awesome job on that burrito it was massive! love ya joel!
I love ur videos they are so satisfying I love when u take big bites
Wow bro

It might be strange because I used a translator. I&#39;m always cheering and watching from Korea. I don&#39;t really like eating videos
para la gente ce no saben en honduras la yamamos pastelitos
Yes it does good onesGreetings from Puerto Rico

Hola amigo! soy de Argentina
Hi

Absolutely delicious!

The context on this fantastic channel just amazing too and this man is a real king of real food
Those look so bomb

Looks and sounds soooo delicious! Compliments to the chef again

Evening all! Apparently it's National Philly Cheesesteak Day in the USA
no one will be fine in a hospital these daysÇ i thought you may have realised that after covid buddy. Love ya videos proper funny
Philly cheese steak comes out followed by a dude in a Philadelphia Flyers jersey... nice touch
She soo lovelyù bless her
Looks like the place is owned by Philly natives (my original hometown) with the Flyers
The Appalachian region of Western NC and East Tennessee has some of the most beautiful country and nicest people one could encounter.  The Great Smoky Mountains region is a magical place which is probably why it is the most visited National Park in the US with 11.3 million visitors in 2023.  Hope that Beard enjoys touring the area and shattering food records.   Still looking forward to the Beard vs. Joey Chestnut showdown.  Hopefully they can make it happen.
Such a gentlemen &amp; a scholar.. And a damn beast too
He&#39;s pretty chill
Recently moved to TN and was glad I found a good cheesesteak within 30 minutes. would of never know of this place without seeing this video. thank you!
I feel like this professional eaters should leave the price of the plate as a tip for all of the mom &amp; pop's dining rooms
as a philly native
Heck yeah you are in my home state am from Nashville
Philly fans in Tennessee
I'll probably eat the fries anyway
These guys definitely tried to fuck Adam! No way in hell that was only 5lbs. I bet anything though they will stick to there guns and say it was. To not look like complete cheating ass hats and so they can still entice other people to do ther challenge under false pretense. I know Adam is humble and says its alright
Yay Tennessee - best place ever!
I challenge you to chip up and eat a whole 5kg bag of potatoes.
Dont shoot
Why are you not trying to eat more and set a new record 
That looked like over 5.5 lbs of cheesesteak. Took it down like a champ and didn&#39;t ask for it to be weighed. The consummate professional our man Beard.
Is there any update on the framed pic?
that had to have been closer to 7-8 pounds.
haven&#39;t you eaten like 15 lb meat or something in one sitting? 5 pounds seems light for you
it looks good
That boy looked confused?
This guy is a beast. Very polite as well.
Glad you&#39;re aware that not doing it in Philly does make less real cheesesteaky. Fried oreos are gangster though.
Adam dude you are the king. Never cease to amaze with how much you fucking eat and how fast! Nice work you shouldve done 6-7 lbs
It&#39;s the 26 slices of cheese on 3 subs for me!2 subs get 9 slices
Everybody in the picture gets one sandwich and he gets 
That was easy for you bro
Those country folks have no clue how to spell YouTube
Congrats.
Honestly
Beard is a beast! That looked like 10 pounds of meat lol smashed it
Great video man. Has there ever been food in a challenge that you dont like?
The girl at the counter reminds me so much of the babysitter from &quot;The Incredibles&quot;.
Aw man I wish I would have known that you were in rogersville aka RogVegas
Beard is living a dream. Seems like a happy job to have lol.
May the weather be milder when you seek challenges that are wilder.
&quot;You always wanted to meet a youtuber?
Lol that dessert look
Reckon you should do a challenge at elland road at halftime mate for a charity or something
That lady working there was so sweet
You&#39;re a stud. I love the channel. Been watching for several years. Keep up the good work
You da man
Last time I saw eating habits like this
You should attempt the breakfast challenge at penguin cafe in Wednesfield WV11 1TW
Got ya there with the dessert with &quot;what about each of one&quot;
As someone who lives in nc I've been waiting for ya to come here sadly I missed ya
A Brit requesting American root beer? Okay
Still waiting for a video from Denmark
lol ha ha ha ha
when do we get a room tour of where u keep all your shirts and  what not? i would love to see ur stack of shirts nowadays
You don't need to eat the fries I am going to eat them anyway
With so much time left they shouldve given you the chance to push the record up higher. You probably couldve gotten at least another pound down.
Beard I think you need to do a challenge where youre not allowed to drink during the challenge just eat ∑çôÇ∏è∑çôÇ∏è
This guy is cool asf.. the young lady made the vibe dope!! The I could have done that in a hr
Bro plz do a sweet challenge
Try Mooneys Mac challenge Big flats Ny or Corning Ny!
You should do BIG TEXAN STEAKHOUSE in Amarillo TX 
Who&#39;d you give the gift cards to.
Wheres the ingredients of the Philly cheese steak.. all I see is meat ??
Rootbeer?  Interesting.
FEAR..the Skinny
I do the same thing but with beer. Lol
The waiter is such a sweetheart
We will feed you till your done
Passing by hickory NC anytime soon?
You should make this a yearly stop and up your record by a half pound each time. Make wall a solid beard group photo. Ö
Don't shoot!
Go birds!
Beardmeatsfood
The waitress is an absolute angel
You should come to Chattanooga Tennessee. Iam sure there's plenty of record to be beat here but a cool city nonetheless
Great content as always
Fair play bro I couldn&#39;t finish 1 of them sandwiches never mind dessert that&#39;s impressive.
an hour lmao that&#39;s sooooo easy
That looked gross
Probably been suggested before but &#39;Cool hand Luke&#39; movie
The girl was so sweet.......must have a proud family
How can he eat so much?
Wooooo
Awesome job
Way to go Mr beard
I would like to see a video called &quot; beard after the challenge &quot; .  How can you eat so much and stay so slim ? Love your videos 
Hey beardmeatsfood when are you going to attempt the 12lb Burger Challenge in Port Talbot
BRO GO TO A BRAZILIAN buffet and DESTROY their business
Are you coming to finland this summer filming some videos with jesse
Such a sweet soul of a waitress. Wish her the best in life.
What happens to all that food. it has to come out somewhere.
Why eat the fries and oreos? Order more cheesesteak to put you in the untouchable realm?
I did not know you were 10 minutes down the road from me. I&#39;ve driven past this place so many times and never stopped cause I wasn&#39;t sure about it.  That food looks amazing.  Wish I coulda been there to see you take this out
Your so sexy beard
Philly cheese challenge  not in philly
If it's not from Philly
With that gorgeous beard
I genuinely love your content.  I don&#39;t necessarily like food challenges
That meat looked dry and unseasoned. The Fries overcooked and burnt.
Hey Beard
