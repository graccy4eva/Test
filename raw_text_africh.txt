 21c skills is our learning platform which we've designed to help African students startups and developers gain skills that they need to succeed in the technology age in the 21st century 21c skills has been built for the African tech enthusiast if you are interested in learning about blockchain or machine learning or data science if you have a university degree or maybe you're just curious about the technology and you'd like to learn more you're an industry professional that wants to gain certain industry certifications all of these are types of students that we're looking for we have content for people that want to come associate AI specialists we have another piece of content that helps people go through training become associate data scientists and then we have one helps them become associated software developers I think those are three key pillars when you think about skills that you need to compete in the 21st century 21c skills for me means eyesight you've got to have very qualified people trained as through video and we also got to have highly interactive labs that challenged me and I think if I was in a traditional environment maybe it would not be as interactive as that platform has been formed there's a ploy information of smart connected devices across the continent so it just makes sense right we can't build enough brick and mortar classrooms to be able to reach you know people with a required set of skills so an online platform like journalist these skills that Africa just seems to be the no-brainer solution to this it's been an amazing experience because it's opened my mind to a lot of things that I could do a machine I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for a platform to increase knowledge their capacity to be able to make an impact in any factor that they are Amy I enjoyed interacting with people from different countries in a platform and you get to see like there is a large pool of young people across Africa the skills that be very beneficial in it include the interaction come come up with solutions we paired with the data science competition called data hack for fi that is hosted by eye to eye base in South Africa they are training data scientists across the continent through our platform 21 sea skills Africa to go from being data enthusiasts into becoming data scientists so we're here at Narvik garage today for the first meetup where the data enthusiasts are getting to come together discuss their progress discuss any challenges hurdles they've had in their learning journey it is a very good platform for someone who wants to grow in data sounds because it covers both soft skills and hard skills for us one of the most important things is that locals know local problems so we want to capacitate these junior data enthusiasts with the skills so that they can solve the problems that they know best we found that when we do that we get the most appropriate solutions because they're solving a problem that directly affects them or their community every year 10 million kids into the job market 6 million of them typically won't fight work it's at that scale that we need to deliver this capability the best way to do it is on one take literacy skills program which a lot of what he needs a tiny needs but it does feel I feel honored actually get it because it is so hard to juggle between school work and this online course I would definitely recommend 21c scheme platform to anyone from any background who just wants to get their feet wet in the world of analytics and up a fan it's a fantastic place

online learning has become so important and popular to young Nigerians have combined the power of technology with storytelling by developing an innovative elearning app that tells African children's stories in their native language suggestions departments has that story when Dominica yakichi sister asked him to read a story to his knees little did he know that simple requests would drive him to create what is today and innovative educational app Dominic's asked his sisters mini library at home and none of the storybooks he found there what his fancy none of the books reflected African societies and known has black characters which is what Dominic wanted so I took one day I went to the markets and there were thousands of stories in the markets but very very few African stories so after like four hours of scoring book shops in Bali goon I think and how could only get one story that was Africa and it was known African animals not even people for instance so I feel that was problematic so I decided to write story for her so when I wrote the first story and got my friend my other co-founder to illustrate it she liked it our first liked it I wrote another one and I decided that it's a problem that I didn't need to solve only for my niece the problem that a lot of girls love boys all over Africa and Nigeria had to so I decided to develop a lot of the stories and put it on an app make it available in multiple indigenous languages so that people everywhere and anywhere can access the stories that app is now known as a kid ian has about 30 books with around 2,000 subscribers since its soft launch in September 2019 and despite just being in its testing phase a kitty is already the biggest a library of books and indigenous languages in Nigeria we narrative ministry can go a long way in shape in the mind of student this shows that you didn't watch the books they read know about white before about white face can't see through them the possibilities that can happen birth can also give them an excuse not to aspire to those possibilities also I think we need to buy into the ownership of values and ownership of culture and that is exactly what a kid adores it's an ownership that everybody or a story that every but India can buy into with three languages translated why would we reach 80% of non-jewish populations but the subscription fee of as low as $3 young children can have access to the books available on the app their effort is also helping to preserve local languages and make books accessible to people in their local languages in a country where the English language is almost swallowed local dialects have children all the way in America where everybody uh they have access to this application you have easy access to these stories so they get thing about your traditions they get thing about your language yeah lots of African languages to digitize we can discuss Swahili that's over 600 million people in East Africa speak Zulu kusa and all these other African languages so I think digitizing African languages and making sure that Africans in the Diaspora can be able to like be literate in African languages is a very big impact and sub-points for a kid despite their modest success the safe funding still remains a big challenge that literally boost dropped off to this point but they are not allowing that slowed them down a kiddie set to launch formally in this quarter currently three schools already pre signed up on the app the projection is to have around fifty thousand subscribers at the end of 2020 deja battle CGT n Lagos Nigeria

 zimbabwe is vfex that's the victoria falls exchange the new stock exchange in victoria force another one in harare is looking at five new listings early in 2022. western 2091 because an african focused e-learning platform educoya announced on wednesday i was yesterday it has raised 3.5 million dollars in a pre-seed funding round the company says the new funds will enable its transition from beta to live launching next year as well as expand and support span african and european developer hubs joining me for the chat to this is honey she is the founder and chief executive officer of education congratulations madam 3.5 million dollars at this time of the year it's been a long walk give me your key focus at educate why looking for this precede funding thank you very much for having me um so ed let's start with what educoya is we are an education uh technology company we are building a digital curriculum for students as well as connecting students to expert tutors uh we spent very months speaking to teachers parents and learners and really learning about the experiences we wanted to develop a better experience for for most of these communities by giving them access to high quality education and so a lot of our preceded funding is going towards that uh looking at how we can create a better learning experience and really connect more people to high quality education allowing them to have more success not only in school but in their career and in generations to come uh let me let me let's chat a little bit to the investors give me the who is who list how you got the fund who is supporting you well first of all we're super excited uh 3.5 million dollars is the largest uh funding received in precede in edtech in in africa and also one of the largest for a female founder ceo startup so this is a record-breaking round uh we're really excited to be back by some top uh european vc which is target global they have over 1.5 billion in assets in managed assets and also we brought some strategic angels on board mostly founders so we have founders for example of cuda we have the founders of a fintech unicorn uh in in europe and a stash and also another unicorn company axe money as well as the founder of pay start i think it's really great that we see an ecosystem emerging when founders start to back other founders and and really being able to put the strategic ground together to basically help us create a company which we hope will be one of the biggest learning platforms in africa and one of the most valuable tech companies in in this space so in terms of the deployment of the 3.5 million dollars you you talk about it i want you to to expand that a little bit for me in terms of what needs to change uh would you be migrating to other platforms what type of education would you be providing across africa where would be your main hub give me a little bit about also what your footprints will look like moving forward in the mid in the short term medium term thank you i think that's a great question so our current focus is nigeria we're focused on secondary school students so today users learners and their parents can download our free learning app on the app store and use it to prepare for their exams either jam or yx or all their school secondary school exams most of our funding is going to be used to develop better content curriculum content that students can use to to study in those categories we're also going to be focusing on online tutoring so one of the key things we want to do is connect students and parents at the time they need it with teachers wherever they might be in nigeria so think of a student in lagos so think of a student in jigawa we want to make it instant for them to connect with extra tutors so the funding is really going towards broadening our product feature set um enabling us to go from beta which uh we are currently into live format and also allowing us to launch this new online tutoring product which we discovered we're also going to be investing a lot in technology so currently um our hubs are in lagos and in south africa and also in london where we're headquartered and we're going to be seeing building bigger development teams and investing more in the technology stack that allows us to to build up this platform uh after we do this in nigeria successfully then probably in in future coming months you'll see us start thinking around our pan-african footprint but for now our core focus is really nigeria where there's a really big market to address 1.9 million people take that jam exam every year 86 of them fail there's a lot of work for us to do in terms of improving high quality education and access and also improving educational outcomes for the students in those buckets very interesting uh proposition you put it on the table but again it comes at a cost how affordable will this service be to nigerian young ones you know i'm sure you're very well aware part of your target is nigerian young girls who are out of school and a whole lot of others in certain parts of the country we have a huge population of young girls and boys some of them also are out of school so do you think this service offering will be affordable to them so the main the at the heart of what we're doing at educare is really how do we make high quality education more accessible more affordable for more millions of learners across africa so one of the things that we are now trying to do the first uh learning app that we're launching is actually free so today you can download the app start using that digital curriculum for free start talking to tutors for free that's a key part of sort of my vision and on our team's vision when we build this we really want to enable more access more affordability so for now that um platform is provided free over the next coming months as we prepare to launch we're going to develop more premium features which will be paid for but we'll always have a sort of base layer which people can access for free that's just part of our vision tell me about that competition that you expect from other online learning platforms honey so i mean i think ed tech in nigeria is quite a in nigeria in africa as an early space for me most of the competition is really uh offline so we're really having to educate the market from having to go to tutorial centers or having a lesson teacher come to your house or buying 1000 textbooks we're telling you now well you don't have to go anywhere you can download one app at require uh you can access all the textbooks you need you can access all the you know access to teachers you need that's a real big step change for many parents and families right you don't have to do that offline so that's that's where the competition is at we're we're pioneering a new industry or pioneering a new way of living uh and learning and that's where a lot of our core focus is going to be you know educating the market um there are a couple of other online players who are who are starting to to rise up in this space but we're also very unique because we're offering 100 uh online model and we're offering a free learning experience to start and we're also looking really closely at digitizing and providing instant access to tutors so what we're doing no one is doing it quite the way that we're doing it well thank you for your time tonight i wish you all the best junior good day ceo and founder at educore wish you the best thank you so much  bye

Victor or koukin I Oh welcome to Africa 54 thank you very much under corvid a lot of people had stuck at home they don't know what to do but for you you decided you're not going to get stuck in the house you're going to do something and that you came up with something very innovative well what's that all about the best opportunity on this comes in a crisis situation okay which means there must be a problem for you to solve so I sat down and I said I can actually create something that will help communicate with this kids teach them give them more knowledge and make them grow intellectually and we started working on that we started with the first we created the faces of platforms the first phase was actually to see to make choose the parent comment board because you don't want to just pump them in and they were all run away so we started with sending links of the platform okay so the platform was created and we started sending links so they will go to the platform and they will be able to connect and use it very easily just from their mobile phone and we did that we piloted that for three weeks just to make just to put them up to speed and after that we now launch them into the real platform where now every child has like an automated ID which is the email and that email you can use it as a mobile call you can call the child immediately from the school the teacher can actually communicate with with the with the with the students the students can call the teacher that platform is basically like a one-on-one learning center which every child needs at some point and we have seen a tremendous growth in learning and even kids who don't concentrate a lot in class in fact we are we are blown away at their the way they perform in their weekly tests and I know that most parents are saying how can I get my kid to access in learning what is it that I need to do you have to have special skills do you have to know how to operate a computer to operate a smartphone basic thing to to do I love that question is first of all we keep singing it in the school you must get yourself a technology which is a laptop or something close to that because for a child to be able to compete in this in the new world order that we are in right now you must have that technology number two you must have internet access okay because for communication to be to be smooth within your institution and the home you must have that that that in place so those two things are key is so easy because when you open a platform all you will see is your teacher your class and and that's it what is it that you've done at least two other three that these skills are up-to-date with the lessons they are receiving from the teachers and make sure that your your software or your the technology you're using is not compromised by anything or like hackers for a club or any time the child lock see we'll see mobile phone check the password check and once the code is sent to the parents we see it was the parents give those code see so we know the parents have approved for that learning to take place now if the press is not approved for that learning to take place there is no way that I can get into that platform so what about your parents are who are not a technologically savvy we did we did train them we created a support base so that support base help parents to even when they make mistakes they can call the school and say oh I can't go in here and I will guide them through that and you can imagine right now school is going on smoothly with almost a hundred and eighty people studying and there's no hiccup as a person now who has spent a lot of time in this technology space what's the future of technology Africa and what's the future of Alani I think this is the future believe me even if this covert is over I can I can tell you hundred percent people will not want to go back to the normal traditional way of learning what is the future of IT IT has just taken off trust me technology breaks the barrier technology break is the bondage of having a good education thank you so much victor for your time thank you so much
" SIMON MOKGOTLHOA: We used to
play football in our township, and we knew a lot
of talented guys, some guys older than
us, who we always thought were going to go pro. Once we realized that their
football careers never amounted to anything,
we just sort of saw that this is a common
problem in our township. We thought to ourselves,
what could we do to sort of solve this problem? LESEGO NDLOVU: We wanted to
enable undiscovered talent to be discovered. We had wanted to
launch BallTalent, but we didn't have the coding
skills to make the application, nor did we have the funding to
acquire programmers to build it for us. So Simon and I said that we
could just learn ourselves. SIMON MOKGOTLHOA: We'd
have these all-nighters where we're just writing
code and watch YouTube videos the whole time just on coding. But not being able to meet
other developers was basically one of the biggest
challenges we faced. LESEGO NDLOVU: How we first
learned about the GDG program was through Google
Developers video. We then went to the
GDG Johannesburg. SIMON MOKGOTLHOA: The
ability to collaborate with really
experienced developers, people who understand
Google tools like the back of their hand-- I mean, it's so amazing. LESEGO NDLOVU: We used
Node.js and V8 engine. We also used the Google Chrome
DevTools and the Google Cloud platform when we actually did
then deploy the application. BallTalent's an application that
professional clubs and scouts use to find new talent
for the academies. SIMON MOKGOTLHOA:
Through our web app, I mean, the ability
to shine a light on the talent in this country
and continent, hopefully, and expose it to the world-- this is so possible. LESEGO NDLOVU: BallTalent has
over 10 clubs that use it, five scouts, and we also
have over 200 players on our platform currently. SIMON MOKGOTLHOA: The
feedback that we've gotten, from whether it be
players or scouts or clubs, it's been quite immense. LESEGO NDLOVU: Plans for
BallTalent in the future is to grow the business so that
we can increase our impact. We would love to get
into other sports-- basketball, cricket, rugby. Over the years, it came
up that it would be great if there was a GDG Soweto. SIMON MOKGOTLHOA: And
we were like, well, OK, let's give it a shot. The one problem we
always cried about, we were actually
part of solving it. And being able to see and
share ideas with people from around your community
is just so empowering. "

this sentence should be read out at step one it's basically the similar syntax with a paragraph below and with those dashes around it just like this simple tiny description so this is the part it should be spoken about that describes animation step one can do this then afterwards for the correct one animation step two today we are cooking aled and we need the following ingredients first chop the onions finely and then sweat them in a large pot with the olive oil then deaz with water and as it starts boil break the F carrots directly into PT I can go back again first chop the onions finely and then step backwards step forward actually and it's just idea and what it uses it use this case Chrome has a pretty good text to speech output actually you have to test this for your Chrome is pretty good but there if you're on Windows on Mac they should be also quite good on Android and you've seen this also in the feature phones it's the same it tries to the browser accesses a text to speech engine that's Chrome has its own but the other one Tex speech engine that's offered most Case by the operating system and if there's no one offered uh we also have a all back so in this case we prefer browser based TTS Text to Speech but they are also like like uh use an open service for this responsive voice for the non-commercial that's why we have to display it like this and what you can it depends so this kind might be because it sends uh the text somewhere else and then depending on uh how much the service are using uh the text might become a bit might be a bit come later or not that in time if you're using the browser based so prefer to use a browser that supports text the speech output otherwise you can use this uh responsive voice and uh as a last feature and this works uh offline so actually you can style this if you want to we have this translate with Google so experimentally so it's not that Google and the translation engine they are always aware of this uh uh content or that your students are actually using it or something like this but if you click on this I want to translate the content experimentally and I don't have to the the the the the parts the the the script actually the code the code that is necessary is then afterwards injected into the Le script so Google add probably some more stuff to it and then we can change the language probably into let's try French so wait a second uh already translated as you see so in this part and if everything worked well so so we also have this you can switch on to the uh manual mode also you see you see the text is translated but we have also methods if you're doing for example like a language course so you mix up different languages you can also we're in total control of this but Google Sees so we can also say this part should be actually stay for example if you have code block this should not be touched uh by Google by the Google translator this part should be this and this one should be not so this just like an easy feature and if everything works well check to this one so you see the code is below and if we increase it a bit so it's better render it like this so it's another kind of visualization oh so this is just one opportunity you have a fixed uh piece of no not of code you have your fixed course actually but you can use also the freely ailable available methods like Google translate takes the speech engine to translate this probably so that one of your students uh is using this language one of you using students this this language but you have created it in another one know so just like of course the best way over is to translate the content to have it separately so that you have specifically changed it for the culture it's like like we've learned so yeah
 a unique event Cote d'Ivoire is set to host Africa's largest conference and exhibition on technology supported learning skills and development Elon in Africa is a platform of experts professionals and investors committed to the future of education in Africa hello and welcome to a new episode of trace Tec your high-tech rendezvous and see our TV news in today's edition we take you to discover what eLearning or virtual learning is all about e-learning makes further education a reality for tens of thousands as we shall see in this edition stay tuned I will be back after the break Virtual Learning is an ideal solution to the barriers that face African students in accessing quality education taking classes online can address some of the bigger challenges of the continent universities and institutions in Cameroon like the ICT U and the national advanced school of engineering in yaoundÃ© has gone far as e-learning is concerned gladys assaulters asthma education is constantly changing the way students learn and how instructors teach technology is the driving force behind these change in line with these de ICT University just like the national advance School of Engineering has used virtual learning to train thousands of students in the ICT University we are using several applications we have the platforms a learning management platforms and the one we use particular here is called the module module learning platform we use it to teach we also use it for other issues like administration we can also program courses as teachers so that our learners can access the material in real time and even when they have not been able to attend class the model platform can help students or learners that are not on site to able to take their classes professors use programs and applications including whatsapp on Skype to communicate with students but classes are taught using special software the Skype calls also very very good we also use them here they help us especially in the video in the video we can do Skype video calls and talk to I mean and conduct lectures and sit in that we are the instructor is seen on video in real-time to the learners wherever they are conducting their classes from so the beauty about such platforms is that they can be used wherever the learners can use them wherever they are and it helps in learning most students have never been to the United States but hold either a bachelor or master's degree from an American University and these stands to ilium so it helps me like attend my class wherever I am I must not be on campus to attend so now you see we are on a life we're in a live classroom this is a tendency I'm somewhere this is my name and the lecturers name so you yeah you see D the number of people who are present okay the video mode share your webcam despite the advantages of e-learning poor internet remains a great challenge nevertheless some IT experts say online learning tools can connect African students to massive open online courses such as Kucera an education platform that provides free virtual tuition from some of the world's top universities but what are some of the challenges facing African students in accessing elearning platforms in Africa professor Victor amber Rica and ICT experts has the answer take a listen oh absolutely you know in much of not just Africa but in much of the developing world there are serious issues of internet okay in fact even in the United States believe it or not there are rural areas in the u.s. that do not have good internet access in fact no internet access we are built our e-learning platform in a way that can run on very low bandwidth and that is a very powerful part of what we do as I see to university being able to provide elearning facilities to areas to reach out to areas with very slow internet and now the other thing is students can access it using their our normal data on their phones which they use for what's-what's up and other things they don't have to buy any kind of extra type of connectivity to access our our e-learning platform and actually experienced full scale learning another really really important thing now is now the lecturers can teach using smart boards as they are writing on the smart board it is broadcast throughout the world anywhere the student is they can access that with just the regular internet connectivity provided by regular Internet service providers in Africa or in the developing world other developing parts of the world where we operate and so truthfully in terms of since 2015 to present we have not had real issues with students not having a way to connect they use the irregular specially developed network in a global tech news the fourth in international conference an exhibition on ICT for education training and skills development dot eLearning Africa kicks off an October 2013 Kosovo education and Technology are changing Africa there are key elements in the African Union's 2063 vision for a transformed continent according to the United Nations the conference is organized by the government of Cote d'Ivoire another theme the keys to the Future II learning and employability Cote d'Ivoire has a booming ICT sector to division an initiative of the country's Ministry of digital economy and post ICT based initiatives now represent nearly 8 percent of the country's GDP and the figure is expected to reach 15 percent by 2020 the country's enthusiasm for new tech based solutions has led observe Rus to refer to it as the start of nations in Africa the government of Cote d'Ivoire has made the digitalization of customs finance and education top priorities the creation of the virtual University of Ivory Coast the distribution of digital health cards and vaccination records as well as the creation of the digital Youth Foundation to fight youth employment examples of some new ICT initiatives global tech news thousands of investors start oprah's businessmen and engineers have taken part in the e-learning exhibition in Addis Ababa Ethiopia 32 international firms showcase the latest innovations and the office during the 10-day exhibition let's get their reactions compiled by AFP my recommendation is for those investors to look out to these kids young people who have all the creativity and supports them to grow the young people are hungry for knowledge they are curious they want to learn they want to discover the ones who invent they don't want to do the big things in the old way they want to embrace development and actually transformation I get to meet people from across the continent coming in and and talking about different industries and what inspires them and what what they want to do you know futuristic kind of outlook to see and improve the problems that they have in their own most valuable thing about you learning Africa is really the people you've got people here inventing really the future of learning the future of the people of Africa and that's exciting to see the passion and to see the creativity and to see the innovations looking at the past and getting guidance from that in order to determine what our future should be not the tone from outside by by Africans and for Africans  in our discovery Caravan today we get to meet biogas part a youngster Thapa CEO and founder of a mobile application call to diagnose he is online from Nairobi in Kenya hello gasps paths and tongues for Turkey to see our TV news stutter prayers came under the spotlight as Cameroon observed World start of the so tell us who assist etapa thank you it's octa-pie sequencing an improvement or who feels the problem and decide to use innovative techniques b2b business model and marketable so gasps but you are one of the successful startup us in the country and presently you are in Kenya in Nairobi to represent Cameroon at the next Einstein forum can you talk to us about your experience sixteen after I graduate so I created we were training 18 so we trained more than 500 you are now some of them completed their own ventures succeeding after that I created this mobile app diagnosed which is my recent start over the diagonals one more than five Awards in international so recently it was given the best science innovation during the African science week organized by next edge time for an African Institute science I think the journey was tough it was not just colorful but it was very tough that once with determination and self-confidence when a gas but we all know their status in Cameroon like any other status in the world faced a lot of challenges what are some of them okay firstly the world still mystical forest the terrain is not adapted to for example we use limited network of standard development meaning you have limited resources to develop data so you the resources face a world and we need to finance expertise so we needed to pull online env2 that they respect us and they still to learn about the technology techniques like design thinking and making to make someone be ready to develop a set with the limited resources also the other side we have that sense that really working hard to reduce on startups is through that the first year the government exempt they give an exemption for one year this year seems that it exists and then there are also the problems like Internet connectivity is that our sometimes new which effect what please understand that is a some of the challenges it's here that we drop the curtains on this edition of the program take the appointment take the rendezvous next week as we bring to you more developments on I cities you can equally send in your contributions your comments and proposals on our Facebook page and Twitter account hashtag Fred Stacy until then stay tuned to programs on CR TV news  [Applause] 
 so ladies and gentlemen uh once again the African travel teacher is here with an interesting video I landed at the booth of German Academy of digital education and I am excited about taking taking my skills to the next level with augmented reality I've never had an experience with augmented reality and uh my friend uh Alex Alexander is going to tell me what augmented reality looks like how we can use it as teachers in the classroom because these Innovation is what I promis to bring you to my YouTube channel so Alex yes tell us so nice that you're here um so we prepared the demo version for our solar technician uh it gives the user or the student uh the possibility to actually train uh with the inverter and how to use the cables um it's rather simple and we can start any any second any you want per good I just need a controller to set it up okay so you see my hands are getting tracked and this is the inverter and it needs to get on the wall so I just um it's rather simple you just really close your hands when you pick up something so you see now you can see on the iPad it's in my hands mhm so I put it here MH and uh so that was the inverter now I take a screw I put it in the side I take the screwdriver and screw it in nice uh-huh and really place it now now let go with your hands perfect very good job uh best case uh grab it like this grab it like this it's easier yeah um yeah and take a step back then it will come perfect uh From Below From Below yes a bit more to the left you almost have it you need to go a bit down and up you know like really plug it in and it's a bit more to the left as well you can see the Hologram of it it's quite hard at the beginning I know but try to grab it again if it's possible nice and yes right there so you pick it up with your left hand pick this one with your left hand this one yeah pick it with your left hand okay you got it and now look to the video look at the video so you need to take both components yes got it and now you need to put it on top yeah and now change your hand and twist it like that no the other way uh like hold your hand like this you see my hand like this yes yes yes and now just spin it in try again and now you need to screw it yes you got it first try very good and now you can now you can put it in and more to the left where the arrow is yes very good sir okay do you see the antenna the small antenna in front of you yeah uh to the a bit more to the right here here I need to tick here yeah yeah you need to tick on the right side what do I tick so you just did the the positive cable very good then this is the antenna uh no that's that is the negative one so now you just uh put this one in yes a bit higher very good okay um now so the antenna is straight in front of you the antenna right there yeah so this one goes where the arrow is a b TI yes very good I think this is one of the best ways to teach people how to fix things especially when it comes to technology technology is so had to put the solar Inver and then put the different cables and then screw them I think this is the way learning should happen right and it's is it also fun a bit right yeah it's fun my question is how do we get this to stud remote areas without the internet well uh you can use it without internet inter already so the internet we just use it for streaming everything is on the quest so you don't even need a computer you just need the glass and the application awesome yeah thank you so much of course been a pleasure to learn from you video and share it yeah if you want you can also take a record of the video we have there okay it just shows the whole process again awesome we come for it yeah thank you thank you 
I think it's not it yes yeah okay we are very small group it's perfect to the idea of either active workshops so don't hesitate to ask don't ask for support from my side if you explain something and you are not able to implement this thing in your set system first we planned a short introduction but I guess most of the aspects are already mentioned here originally we are roboticists working on systems for swimming applications and driving applications map environments and representations of Uncertain knowledges our Focus and with aquatic robotics we support our colleagues from different departments in automated measuring processes on lakes and seas and we have a second interest research interested e-learning as I already mentioned we completely switched our strategy and deleted all the PDFs with passwords and all these things from our service and opened a setup of information to our students on open materials our students for an interactive discussion during the learning process and of course your script was one result of this process yeah and then again introduced myself so my name is Andre Dietrich I'm the maintainer and to say core developer of Leah script and yeah I've worked some long time ago also with robotics but my focus is now mainly focus is in this language development and building compilers and web Technologies so I somehow fell in love with the idea of creating open educational content in a very easy and as I say engaging or something like this way so yeah probably just for illustrating where we come from Freiburg University one of the oldest technical universities in Germany it's in the center south of Berlin Center of Europe of course and no you know very close to the resource Rich area with generated it's focus on resources what was his starting point and you saw that remote Laboratories are a connection point in my work and endless activities um this is unfortunately a German movie illustrating one of our first project the national founded projects and here we have some small robots moving around and you are able to control them as a student from your laptop from anywhere 24 7 hours you can write your code directly in the browser this was ideal and we had eight of them operating in our laboratory and the students use them completely free very flexible and just at the end we evaluated their results their codes directly in the laboratory but the problem Andrew already mentioned was I was not able to change any piece of task description any piece of hints included in this very a huge block of code of the system and here in the movie it looks perfect it's fine but for practical issues it would be much more helpful if you have another abstract representation of learning materials that helps to include some interactive elements but it's flexible to adapt its content and that was a starting idea for Leo script and we in the beginning in 2017 we used or we looked for an opportunity to include in interpreter for learning content in such an application in the meantime we left the idea of remote labs and focused on the representation of learning materials we will now give a very short and motivating overview about the features and afterwards you are inviting to learn step by step how to implement the code from our the Tactical idea is to have an impressive motivation in the first part of this session and afterwards we hopefully work through the theoretical Parts description elements and so on and we will give this presentation share this link also with you a few seconds hi I am Leah script A markup language and interpreter for educational content the goal of my developers was to create open and easy to use way to develop and distribute educational content one of the ideas is to have an international context so text based representation is Henry or you can apply automatic translators on such a system and the idea was to provide different types of consuming data presentation the book style and so on to our knowledge there is no simpler way of creating quizzes and questionnaires probably I did a mistake by connecting the text-to-speech output so it's a problem with it Wi-Fi so that's a pure demo but I damn it sorry I just made a mistake but we can fix this so I didn't mark the contents which should be actually spoken out loud as to be represented but we can do this like online I just go to the Leah script a live editor so there's a few notes you will use this tool in a few minutes I create a new node and I want to use an external resource for this so I just include the link to my original presentation markdown content okay so I get a new link and that's just the live editor referring to the original source so what happens it just loads the code within the browser from the additional source and I hi I am Leah script the markup language and so if I want to change this so this part was missing so it was I want to so that you get an idea so this is the basic text and if I want to read it out loud I just have to give it some hints so this is like a comment that you can speak out loud or that you can show to the audience I will show it to you in a few seconds this was missing and also this goal so this piece of text should be read out loud in the animation step two and the sleeves and you can already realize that the idea we have a text based representation something like HTML or other response but the intention was to find a style of describe hi I am Leah script and Mark and so we have to balance the capabilities of the description language and its complexity in editing of course otherwise everyone will say hey I have to do the studies in computer science before you can use this so this is just like this should be appeared this is the first part spoken out loud the second one where we start by counting from zero in this case so we'll go to the features markdown is intended to be as easy to read and easy to write as is feasible but unfortunately for static content only Leah script is based on markdown and extends it in various ways to our knowledge there is no simpler way of creating quizzes and questionnaires so if you want to solve this quiz the German article for girl is actually neuter it's not female so this won't be marked this by the Knicks and it's actually yeah it's the correct answer so there's a the original goal was to create coding courses fast but the same principles can be used to teach writing mathematics and music theory too you should see this later also we will work with this so if you have some kind of text so will your students create by themselves and you want to analyze this so how is the style probably so you can do this quite easily so we add additional features to extend the language so if I click on the coding example actually it does not code it presents us with an overview on so the content is very difficult to read probably and some it's for actually a college freshman or that's intended or above from the complexity and a lot of also have different stuff so if you're doing mathematics probably you can do some calculations just use another extension the algebra and you can what's factorial 600 or probably like this so you can interactively code and play around with a different Technologies or libraries that are or services that are available within the internet so and you don't have to be a coded to add this we will show you how you can Implement these or add these functionalities afterwards to your course if you want so um written by Community many teachers have specific interests and we will see some music or presentations the next example so we have a collection of plugins that can be combined in the course code and it's not necessary more than to reference their macros and in this way you will embed existing codes specifically focused on your content directly at Utopia so this is just the ABC music notation if you want to compose and so it's actually a standard and you get this nice features that plays the music if you want to and you can directly also I don't know I have no idea what I'm doing for example I can change the code or the notes and it should play them somehow differently so the next step of course you can add any kind of multimedia content and content from other sites as well so this might look complicated or disturbing but these are just links to pictures to some videos and to some other websites or foreign websites so that you can use like you not can not only include this images links multimedia sounds and videos if you want to uh just a bit of Leah script where you're working with some tables but take some time you can also add any kind of if it's possible the Leah script system tries to detect a way to embed this piece of this part from the website into your course so but from some cases so it's actually a 3D simulation you can go and click onto us so it's just linking or referring to this specific website that's it and if the website offers such a service you can also embed this into your Leo script content or code uh and how does it work is it like an iframe or so or it tries to detect different mythologies so the first day is a standard it's called o embed and the websites offer specific texts at their meter information that tell the system okay of course you can embed my content and the main part is this is how you do this so in the first step the script grabs the the browser grabs the website parses the internal internal information is there such a meta information available no then it checks its own database is this service somehow listed so that I can translate or embed this into my system there are like 400 websites that we included and if this doesn't work it at least tries to embed this as an iframe and then it's also responsible if the source provider of the website actually allows to embed this code so yeah so if there's a flag in the server configuration that I don't want to don't allow my content to be shown in other websites it cannot be included but so you have to try it out so but there are a lot of free and open services that provide these take these ah so the last part so I'm sorry what didn't work so don't know so the Google browser this might be a problem so it uses if there is an internet connection it tries to get some one document can be present you can use it for presentations with animation steps read it like a textbook or use it like an interactive screencast just click on the presentation button to switch between modes so if I get to the full presentation again so this delay might be caused due to the due to an internet connection if there is no internet connection Google will just speak it out loud but probably not with the highest quality and if there is an internet connection I will try to increase the quality of the sound but there if you have installed in it works from your smartphones it even works from this feature phone so offline they have a pretty good text-to-speech engine so they can deliver this spoken out loud content quite good and high quality so in the ideals just you have seen this one description of the content and you can use it for different purposes so we used it now for the presentation but you can use it also like in slide mode so that the content that is spoken out louds actually markdown is intended to be as easy to read and easy to write as visible in here so you can click on it it changes depending on the resolution of your device you can make an entire presentation we had but you [Music] autoplay so we read it in textbook mode there will no won't be no steps so okay this is the first animation step I switched to another one it's just like shows you all the contents like as you are used to it in a plain a normal site so what it was spoken out loud before is actually now added into the text where you have put it into it so your users can decide how to use your content into been creating or you can decide in which circumstances you want to give a presentation or you want to do something else or uh with your content another question do you always have like a intelligence login um so for if you for example have an assignment so that's what's in our comes to mind you have the textbook and then you have like an assignment and you have to write an essay and you get the feedback on no that's not possible so well and it's probably possible so you can connect any kind of external Services if you want to but at the moment is just it stores the entire history the entire course within the browser that's basically it colleagues from Australia making experiments with automatically generated EOS script courses on different topics so they use chat GTP for promo hiding the basic structure of the document and there's some notes and then they implement the actual ideas they want to transport manually and that works already like this as they have some Python scripts generally you just yeah supported no but you can simply teach chat CPT to export or teach earlier script syntax so and if you want to have quizzes and stuff like this so you can ask it to generate it so you teach it at first with some prompts and afterwards it will generate the content for you in Leah script so what's the general idea just don't be um shocked by the technical details but what's your idea we have some text documents that can be interpreted by different Learning Management Systems due to the general concept of an interpreter running in your browser nothing more than a huge piece of software that takes step by steps all the information the formula some styling information the interactive elements and rendering the render the website and this can be integrated in different Learning Management systems for providing the content in a way that your students are families for an expert we build up some some tools that helps to transform applications if you are not interested to embed iframes or for some similar then you can use the scorm standards or similar approaches to generate um learning material package which can be applied on your system we will illustrate this with such a very small mobile phone too okay probably just to illustrate the flexibility Andrew integrated the opportunity to switch the language too again it's a piece of text that you can apply automatically translated from it so I'll just get back to the future or just started store importantly a script so there are some like Technologies you can use Google Translate but in this case we are not translating the website but we actually tell Google which parts are allowed to be translated and actually we use this also in the generation of the yeah voices so if I click so Google is not always there it's just like if you click on this import button it will be the code for Google translator will be injected so it's not that Google is monitoring you so probably now they see that I'm doing some kind of translations but as you see we translated this to French it was like Francis in German because my browser is in German and we can change the presentation mode again to presentation switch the sound bonjour yes in this period you continue educative so we can switch back to textbook mode probably um if you will rearrange our seats together [Music] thank you very much okay this is new just Google occupied the piece where I can switch to the next to the introduction but we can also choose like this so I mean okay I shouldn't use the autoplay so in this settings but as you can see the entire document is translated instead but not those German articles probably so the content for German teaching might be still the same in a foreign language but you can Mark those pieces actually that you want to have them translated or not so they should be fixed if you're doing Spanish course or something like this you can translate this same course to French or Italian or whatever so this is the basic idea and this is an important feature if you implement courses on software development of course you have to avoid that the English terms in your code will be replaced by French Spanish or any other items to spend a lot of effort to separate the pieces have to be translated and without any information so now we would like to make a test we mentioned like instant publishing without any costs and this might be this is an example probably how we our latest implementation is the ability to create quizzes online but probably you can participate I just switch again to the script live server and I create a new node so what I did is actually I copied this part of the survey so this is just an idea how you can create quizzes or surveys okay this is actually the survey stuff so basically I copy this into this part it's not shown here the content because you have to recompile it or you hit Ctrl s so it's just like so now it's just we've created a new document and there are different ways how you can share this content so one way and the easiest way for playing around or testing probably the content of your course so you can upload this to Google GitHub gist for example you can create collaboration links but this is now what we added data ooris it looks strange but what we did is you create the launch URL and this is actually where the everything is a text file and the content of this text file is zipped probably all the different formats so this is longer so you have to this is a data format this is a text a plain text and content encoding is in g-zip so if I want to use this content and publish it to my students probably I simply have to click on the link and the entire content of this short course is actually put or add within the URL so that's one idea of how to share course and as you've seen it's always the same wherever you are course might be Milestone on GitHub on Dropbox on your personal website the only thing that you do is you go to audioscript.githab.io if you don't host the website by your own so you're also free to do this course slash question mark and then the URL where your content is actually stored so if I open this it loads the Leah script website with this little survey so what we can now do and probably just invite you to test so we are you see the QR code is a bit more complex but it still works we can create or try to create something like a classroom so they are different web technologies that we try to support depending on your system so you can choose between jitsi which uses how's called Web RTC gamdb is a distributed database that also runs offline so where we just synchronize synchronize our content our course so and simply use gun as a backend so there's somewhere an open server you can also Host this by your own we can create a new room probably either you choose them like randomly or you simply we call it Ela 23. and we connect the URL has changed and you can the QR code works probably maybe you can try and persistent storage this tick is not thick because on Gandhi B you have also the possibility since it's a database you can store your content for later but you can probably open a course so that's the idea and add some uh take your own notes if you want to install this within your randomly choosing room with your private password or something or invite others so that you have not so one main idea of the classroom was that their state is always synced between the browsers so there's actually it's not stored everywhere but if we are using Gandhi B we can also make something like um not online how to say classroom where probably a teacher looks at one time at the comments of the notes of the results of a student and the students at another time comes back oh yeah you have to content shall we do the survey yeah if you're invited true it um thank you the question do you see any changes yes so with multiple users right yeah so something is okay so yeah I can show you the basic idea I don't know why it's not synced yet I was thinking so actually yeah okay the only thing we can try this out later also actually you should now see your shared state actually but I don't know why my laptop isn't connecting at the moment so I see only a classroom of one uh just I'll probably try another browser sorry again to a big picture at the moment we talked about the content and the representation now we switched to the learning management system in light stress in your browser to offer some class specific um separations of environments and here we have the classroom contents again it's a Justin um connection between the browsers of your mobiles of your computers and if you need such a classroom you take all your information with you so it's completely find this European regulations on data okay so this is a bit strange I don't know what's missing so we could try to use another background later but so for me it worked when you um you see the results yeah you see but the ideas you see you see the results if you participate with your own data so uh yeah afterwards but anonymously a combined version of all the stuff but I it's disappointing why it's showing only I don't know what's happening ah because we tested it a couple of times and we use it in lecture and it worked but I don't know why it's not working yet so okay we try this out later again so I guess the idea becomes clear it's an opportunity to work with your students and can you probably switch on the classroom in the discussion area what do you mean additional comments and the opportunity to discuss about so actually you also have something like this chat if it's working where you can place also this actually if it works there's any kind of Leah script content you can do like also quizzes surveys questionnaires if you want to I can directly also copy this coding examples or this little nice gallery that we have seen so just send it and you get this the same content structure actually or yeah the same content if you want to impressive students discuss about the content at this place and the copy additional links or materials I will be explaining some aspects in a better way the reference the movies concept top of video script to support the actual internet changes the students at this point yeah of course the new translate is missing yeah but you get the same quizzes like this so actually the idea what ever you put into your course with the layer script syntax you can also use in the chat so that's the basic idea with some other stuff and this is the thing that we hope we can teach you today so we have a tough schedule in the class so you have your students sitting in the rows and everyone has their laptop and then you display you know this presentation and then you group them into peer groups or so and they can write each other assignments or add resources to the course or um and I'm using the video script ID used in the basic courses where we commonly programming or we try to understand the concepts of different programs and in this way I write programs Wi-Fi project project and programs to the wall and then we discuss about and in many cases no one is wants to talk about but if you ask for some written reviews then students are much more involved and for a in line two there is a problem it so it's kind of anonymization this is very helpful for non-experts to be part of the selection in process so it's it's a mixture of traditional lectures with some new technical elements helpful to catch students from their hesitation yeah no it's actually cool idea it would also work very well in schools I think yeah it's very helpful of course it's an open educational resources it takes this public so students send me pull requests this means they changed some contents they probably corrects typos and added some new code examples and explaining me why hey it would be helpful due to the fact that and then I integrate their pieces code directly to the course and they are referenced as an additional author and this is I guess cool feature that helps to motivate the those students with high experience otherwise they are boring courses illustrating that professors the professors can be approved is one piece in this and due to the facts our level of this integration many of my materials have 20 co-authors from students side and so if you have this also students they want to show up so we make a little programming task and if we teach coding so there are some examples they can run them by their own and so now we added this if there's a classroom open every piece of and if it work every piece of executable code can be switched into a collaborative editor so there will be multiple cursors in this space probably and then you can one student could paste his or her solution yeah in this case and you have an open discussion also on this code or whatever it is music theory or something like this so okay so this is the idea of our schedule that we had so the warm-up is actually done and we would like to invite you now to directly start with us to try to learn online at least script uh play around with it within an online within the online editor that you have seen so far and the basic ideas that we teach you the basic markdowns attacks so this is not something that we invented it's a actually like an international standard and you can also use this if you're in WhatsApp so you can use this notation or if you're using your Moodle and stuff like this so you have always the option to fast create content with this markdown notation so and then we will want to teach you this the script extensions so the idea is basically at first you learn to write and then you learn to speak or how you create these animations text-to-speech output if you wanted this and how you can create quizzes Galleries and whatever there is so then depending on if there's this lunch after the lunch we probably teach you a bit of so we're doing this always in the browser so you can share your own files actually but if you want to collaborate with more developers course designers content creators with one project so there's one opportunity that we also use and this is a GitHub and what we actually do is we create like plugins for different editors and so there's also for the online GitHub editor and plugins so you can create Leah script directly but you can also collaborate with other colleagues and have this as your repository to store your content and publish it directly from there and it's actually free and open to use to be used by everyone so so yeah the classroom will try it out later and last but not least we will show you different methods of how you can deliver your content so as I mentioned it's actually quite easy you have to put it onto somewhere into the internet it could be also in Dropbox or something where you share this link this data over as you've seen it but there's also this possibility like the interplanetary file system there's a support that is supported by a couple of browsers or if you want to do it more securely we demo this like with a tour and onion share which might be not such a good thing but not in every country actually like education is available for free and where the internet is monitored probably like in Afghanistan or other countries so you can like securely deliver your content via this tour network if you want to and you have the possibility to export your content into who will help you to install the exporter so this is a command line tool actually but then you can translate your content to your scorm package IMF if you want to PDF Android is a bit more difficult to set up uh actually I can probably can show it on my laptop but you have to install the Androids SDK and a couple of tools but then it's actually this is done it installs it automatically here's some further help and resources if you want to have this yeah just take a little overview and these are the materials that we are going through today so it's always this the script course and the live editor which just referring to this markdown document both in the same way and to simply create or extend notes or URLs probably you can if you open your browser and you type in this URL we will have an collaborative editor so the first thing that you might open is this yeah shorted link by the GitHub course you can directly place it and the other one is the probably can repeat I'm sorry you're typing any questions so far mentions something I would have one question regarding the export in scorn because typically content would be embedded now in the storm fire how do you deal with content that's maybe temporarily available somewhere in the web and you have it included and then you exported in this form package uh so if you the question is we just refer to some external content so then we just store the reference it's just like if it goes away so all you have to do it manually so that you can also put this download or whatever it is put it into the same folder and refer to this locally and then the scorm exporter will also add this images videos or whatever there is or JavaScript sources also within into the Squam package so the first thing that we're probably going to do is go to the have you all opened this so and then if you're this is our current repository I just where all the content is stored on GitHub actually so what we've done now is just had a look at this readme markdown file so you see it's rendered a bit differently but it's actually the same so the same information is only able to remember action markdown cannot handle your script directly due to this Factor some of the structural elements the iframe itself looks a little bit different but it's helpful to get an overview about the human structure and edit it directly yeah this is just an image of gififi that we added into it and just like it's a little nice to have but probably not the right thing for a ebook or something like this so we've seen this introduction so far this was what I presented also in the same way the images in the script look a bit better and we can go now or have you all opened this website okay so then go now to the script just wait a second the live editor so yours might look a bit different I'll paste this so here so you can copy and paste and you should start with an empty project right there's nothing within so you just click on the new node foreign so there's it's an empty document there's nothing within and one thing if you're just like we'll explain this in a few seconds this hashtag is actually like a header where some you can call it like my tutorial so just like yeah if you recompile this it will generate this simple documents or you if you 444 speeding purposes just Ctrl s so it will create the same thing so now if you go back to the lia edit now for example there will be this my tutorial this is the latest you can reopen this and the content is stored within your browser that's your personal property if you're you can take it with you it's not stored nowhere only on your browser on your device and additionally many data belonging to specific pages and the linear script online editor is one page and all the content you store there is just available on your computer so it's accessed from data if you go to Every course has this home button and if you click onto it so this is the history of all courses that are probably attended create or something visited and these are stored if I don't want to use this you can delete them but all their states of their quizzes and stuff like this this is stored within your browser it's your personal property and you cannot take it to another browser so far it's just like logged into this browser but you can simply export or reference yeah the content and share yeah so just to get you down how how did you come back home you started writing on the new how you wrote my tutorial yes now how did you get to control s or you hit this button for compile yeah but uh how did you get to the library so you typed in ah the airstrip.github.io live editor and then it's available on either pet2 can you switch to the easier ah I'm sorry okay and here we have the link so just but it doesn't show anything yes yes so then you have to click on new new notes yes yes um [Music] so just like in the same way like these courses are stored within your personal index to be the other ones are also stored uh the the courses that you've opened with the Leah script website and there's to show you how to you can open another course content and edit this probably or how you can make a copy of it so you can create if you go to this website again to the list group main website we want to edit not here but in the previewer the content of this tutorial right [Music] do you see it and the only thing that we have to do is just like we don't want to have this edit
ng page stuff like this we want to have the raw content and there's this RAW button and if you click onto this the URL changes and you get the entire this is the URL of the actually of the text file so this is what we share and if you copy this I just click onto it copy it go back to my editor to my latest tutorial you can also copy and paste of course not the URL so this is one method because where was it there was it copy and paste the entire content copy it into your document and if you hit Ctrl s so you will have this entire tutorial tutorial so you now make a local copy of this document for example but what you also can do if you want to refer to only the so another possibility of yeah yes that you are now on the head of this document tutorial keyboard shortcut s yeah okay so you can open the the menu so just like depending on the resolution we have now small resolution it's the the table of contents fills the entire screen so but you can also want to show this quickly just copy the URL I go back to the editor and create something like a I want to refer to an external external resource so you simply copy the URL of this file click on OK and you get a new url url and if you load this it will load the content but it's actually not stored you can play around with any document but this will not be stored as mentioned here within your local browser the first thing you have to do is to make a fork create a local copy of this document so you are free to explore to change the tutorial in the car control it something like this but if I reload this page it will restore the entire content but if you want to work or proceed to work on this document by your own simply create a new Fork so guys the perfect course on embedded systems and I know this his course is after some changes to the editor and taking it away what what's the most strange and then I decide which part I would like to transfer to my course and referencing as absolutely this way it's very helpful much faster than to copy of entries so I would definitely lead to more and more cascading and how do you you know make sure that the original author or contributor knows what's going on but also potentially can embed the improvements at least it is an interesting question and we will discuss about the conversion management but these are only tools for organizing the process they do not ensure that the original author is informed about adaptations that happen to his original materials this is not working with a live editor but afterwards with a GitHub method is probably you can have this assurance that you have multiple authorship you know who is referring to your document made some changes and they can also it's called a pull back those changes so you can see all this Improvement I want to have this in my original documents and you get this new course back all these updates so just like it works for software and software is also just text and it works in the same case also for this document so for these online courses so as you can see it's just I made the fork and the URL slightly changed so this is just an identifier if you go back there will always be my tutorial in the car control s and now it's updated so this is just our starting working basis if you want to we this is like a control and S if you've seen if you make some changes and we'll like recompile those changes you can always visit them or review them so what's going on and the other one not just like little helpers it's called Snippets probably just want to show to you just when you need some help about or you're not sure about the syntax or how to do something like this I want to have a bold text for example to make something bold you could type start Leah and it will just give you some examples and you can go like text okay there are a couple of bold text examples and this is a bit tricky I don't know why this is ah recompile this okay so now we made some bold text so this is the Syntax for this is very bold but in the same way if you want to make a quiz or something like this you just type Leah quiz and we want to make a single Choice probably  so if you want to have more info then appears this little helper that can be extended that shows more information or even an example so compose a single quiz so this is like the syntax and if you just I don't know this one will generate the syntax otherwise this will only add the option but you can always also okay I will just copy this and use this as a working base for later so I can also if I click onto this Leah script single choice so it will add just a little stop and you have generated this quiz and the X always marks the correct position and so but we go to this step by step so this is just a little script syntax and this is just like if you have some question you can always try to Leah audio file audio and we'll show you some examples some hints and if you hit enter it will add you or generate you the basic syntax so and you are free so this is a intended to be in Hands-On tutorial we will go through this step by step but you can make yourself some notes some comments into your document and write it down so probably what we did was just a we tried to do a minimal explanation but you can just if something is more clear to you in your own words so just write it down it's stored within your document so this will be now your tutorial for yourself that you can refer to it later or you can share this afterwards with your colleagues if you want to just rewrite it change it where afterwards so the first thing that you might have noticed uh are you so far so compiling works you can make changes and so the first thing so far you've seen this if I open the table of contents so it's not ordered so this is like the main content so this tutorial and this markdown should be the next sub section or something like this so as you can see these hashtags Define the order or the indentation of your header in this case and they divide your content into slides so this is one slide this markdown until up this paragraph will be another so if you want to attempt it if you want to have the correct order I want to have this paragraph probably to be a sub subsection of the markdown content so what you do is actually this is a a chapter or something like this this is a section like two and this will be a subsection oops that opens so you see paragraph is now smaller okay yeah sure ah okay yeah probably yeah coffee break right so are you okay or fine or you want a starter I don't know I'm curious to see this in practice okay think around a little bit okay so we make a little break okay 15 minutes and afterwards we can watch I was actually uh I couldn't have myself but I tried with Chelsea BT already and it doesn't give you the code no you have a very nice structure for a course yeah this is the idea you train actually uh chat CPD of course you can try and train it with different syntaxes this is the syntax 4 quiz okay if you create a multiple choice quiz this is the syntax and then you just tell it okay I want to have a multiple choice though I had some multiple choice a quiz about this uh content or where it has this issues and stuff like this and it will generate it for you in the description that's when you hit the wrong answer it provides to you yeah yeah it's really

 I  I'm here just to know to see the new technologies that I can apply in my job every day  I think with the innovation we have here in different countries in Africa we have the power and we will be able to challenge the other countries and move forward towards a bright future without coming here it's really hard to keep track of the work that's being done and sometimes it feels like there isn't really work that's being done but coming here it looks like a lot of people and NGOs are doing really fantastic work in Africa I've met a lot of amazing people who has told me that they like the fact that we have the issue of the internet penetration we're doing a lot to educate our people in assets are through innovation this is one of the most amazing inspiring events of attendance Ilan in Africa is an exciting opportunity where stakeholders come together and see how best to use technology now program elearning africa is compelling culturally rich diverse and very exciting elearning africa is amazing  the  you 
so  i hope you enjoy your stay so far my name is albert and singh young i'm the executive secretary of the association for the development of education in africa the association is hosted by the african development bank in abidjan ivory coast it is a great privilege for me to share this first plenary session and i would like to acknowledge the presence of the minister of education from rwanda dr valentine maria thank you minister for hosting the second e-learning africa on the continent so rwanda has hosted this the same event in 2018 so this is the second time let me also welcome everyone here it's a pleasure to see faces that have been seeing in the e-learning africa my first time to attend e-learning africa was in 2010 in lusaka zambia how many of you were in lusaka see so i always say learning africa has become a family and it's really great to see that we are seeing faces coming up whenever the event takes place so welcome you all today it is an incredible achievement to have brought so many people together here in the optimize of the pandemic and it is wonderful that the e-learning africa family has come together again we have nearly a thousand uh participants that have registered and i'm sure more will be joining and i'm sure by tomorrow we'll be able tomorrow morning we'll be able to reach the phone number and understand there are some delays uh with covet testing outside so hopefully in another hour also all participants will be here participants come from over 70 countries mainly from africa which is also a great achievement of course i can mention a few countries that are really on top as always of course the host country rwanda i'm glad to hear that there's a great number from uh participants from rwanda we have kenya who are from kenya here can you just uh so kenya is really leading in terms of number of participants followed by uganda can we see ugandan participant thank you welcome ugandan nigeria is also here as we all say one african out of five come from nigeria so i hope we are meeting the number you know so that's good and of course south africa do we have south africans in the room yeah welcome south africa in this place of course i can continue in a number i was also impressed by the number of usa citizens can you show there's a great number from people from u.s that are in the room thank you welcome welcome to all we would like to thank all of the sponsors and partners some of our leading companies an organization in the world they're here with all their support this conference will not have been possible i'd also like to thank the government of rwanda and in particular the ministry of education minister your team has been wonderful i would like in the name of the illini africa to support him from the ministry has been very very critical to make this event happen so let me really acknowledge their efforts and dedication let me also thank the minister of communication and the innovation hopefully the minister will join at some point the event to share what the country is doing in terms of promoting innovation especially looking at the great opportunities that are given to young people to innovate around technology and of course last but not least the rwanda convention bureau that has been supporting this the preparation from the beginning i would like to acknowledge them as well i encourage you to visit the sessions or there going to be of course plenary but also parallelizations uh the next two days as well as the executive exhibition in the conquest in the foyer so and i'm sure you have seen them they are great solutions that are being proposed so there are great opportunities and so please take your time and visit the exhibition is full of many interesting companies and organization so thank you again for joining this event without taking too much of our time so i'd like to invite defense the speaker mark west he works for the unesco uh education sector where he examines how technologies can improve the quality equity and accessibility of learning especially in a developing country so mark the floor is yours yeah please come [Applause] thank you very much albert your excellencies ladies and gentlemen a real pleasure to be here to address you today um you have a very diverse panel here academic training we have a philosopher we have a futurist and we have an education minister who is trained as a chemist my formal academic training was in history and historians believe that to look forward we need to look to the past we need to reflect on the past and understand what has happened before to move forward wisely we must take time to look back to pause and that's what i want to do today i'd like all of you to sit here today and to think how will you remember the educational experiences of the pandemic those weeks and months and in some cases years in which children were fully reliant on technology for learning i also wish to consider how we we collectively will remember we should care about these questions more than most ed tech is our field and let us be clear-eyed what occurred over the past two years was the largest and longest edtech deployment ever attempted in countries and globally it is common to hear people refer to the world to it as a world spanning experiment but it was no experiment it was a lived reality for learners for teachers for policymakers and all of us sitting here now is also the right time for reflection the memory is molten not yet cast we are still considering debating negotiating what experiences and lessons to retain and gradually this information these remembrances will converge around certain narratives story lines will form settle and harden so i ask you what happened what was the narrative arc of what occurred what are the memories and lessons you will draw what lesson should we draw we cannot shy away from these questions of history of story they will steer what we do tomorrow next month next year in education particularly as it relates to technology in a few weeks unesco will release a major publication to assist this memory making process and it cuts through the hype about edtech it drops the language of potential and observes and describes in plain language with facts and evidence what the global shift from school-based learning to technology reliant distance learning entailed for real people in real places over the past two years and our publication proposes that this experience is best understood and best remembered not as forced progress or uneven salvation as many have proposed but rather as a tragedy its title is an edtech tragedy why tragedy tragedy provides a lens to more clearly see and more fully comprehend the numerous adverse consequences the hard shift to technology entailed these include and just a few the normalization of learning in isolation and at a distance the homogenization of the learning process deepened reliance on private and for-profit service providers to assure the right education an uncritical acceptance that the digital transformation of education is desirable inevitable and a pillar of education resilience tragedy also provides a forceful rebuttal to a growing consensus that the education sector somehow advanced leapfrogged catapulted or disrupted itself to a better future when it deployed technology on a massive scale as a temporary measure and is now being fast positioned as a long-term solution even as the pandemic abates the evidence overwhelmingly points in the opposite direction education became less accessible less effective less engaging when it pivoted away from schools and towards technology exclusively additionally the censorship data extraction advertising top-down control intimidation surveillance that so often characterize our current models of digital change these have functioned to corrupt rather than service our highest aspirations for education these outcomes i want to argue are justifiably understood as tragedies it's hard to see them in any other light the work that unesco will release it spans several hundred pages it cites evidence from around the world and it incorporates the voices of those who experienced learning with technology directly it's impossible to summarize this publication in such a short address so what i wish to do with my remaining time is to examine the promises of technology and contrast them against the reality of what was actually delivered in 2020 2021 and early 2022. in doing so i think you will agree or at least you will open your mind to this idea that the unprecedented and full reliance on connected technology has set education on a dangerous trajectory it is a trajectory at odds with education status as a human right as a public endeavor and as an endeavor that is vital to social and community cohesion well-being knowledge development and citizenship in coming face-to-face with these outcomes we can better imagine new approaches and new models for technology integration and education we can also see with greater sobriety what technology cannot do its many limits and the ways it can constrain our sense of what is possible an overly intensive focus on technology despite its ever growing power and versatility can straight jacket our imagination and lead us to do things that defy common sense so let's take a moment and look at the promises and what education actually delivered edtech has long promised to make education more accessible and more inclusive and when school is closed this is what people turn to this was the way we were going to ensure the continuation of formal learning but what happened most learners a global majority of learners experienced no ed tech at all it did not reach the millions and millions of people who had previously been serviced with education in schools this was if i may exclusion by design we all knew how many people this would leave behind yet we turn to this as an exclusive solution regardless there were many reasons for this but costs and a lack of digital skills were first among them let's talk about some of those costs hardware smartphone affordability is a factor of income varies enormously across countries it ranges at the low end from between four to five percent of the average monthly income in botswana jamaica and mexico two at the high end 222 percent in burundi and over 600 percent the average monthly income in sierra leone yet this is what we told people to use to stay connected to education totally out of reach for huge numbers of people connectivity one gigabyte of mobile data costs about 27 u.s cents in italy in madagascar what does it cost over five dollars in yemen over fifteen dollars and in malawi over twenty five dollars let's talk about digital skills our sister agency itu put out a report in 2022 that estimated in low and middle income countries nearly a quarter 25 percent of adults are not even aware that you can access the internet on a mobile device yet we told these families to turn to that mobile device to access education exclusion from edtech it's severe globally but it is especially severe for women and girls according to reliable data sources women in sub-saharan africa are approximately 40 percent less likely to use the mobile internet than men these gender gaps widen at every stage of the mobile internet journey from awareness to ownership to adoption and finally to regular and productive use of that technology let's look at the second promise that edtech said it would deliver equity it was supposed to give everybody a fair shot at learning it was hailed as a tool that could bring quality education to the furthest corners of our countries and it could untether schooling from the exclusionary and often high costs of educational institutions there was a hope that digital futures would be more equitable than education that had revolved exclusively around in-person schools that was the hope that was the promise what happened inequity was supercharged we didn't even make an attempt to reach the learners who had not already been in school with our solutions our solutions were aimed only at the students who are already being served in educational institutions physical schools by contrast they helped guarantee that modes and models of education provision were reasonably similar for students from different backgrounds and different income groups yet when it shifted over to technology children from upper and middle class families were by many measures twice to three times as likely to access online learning than children from working class families also we must remember virtual learning was not placeless learning the corporal bodies of students did not go away and for many students the physical home environment was a place that made technology dependent modes of distance learning difficult and in some instances impossible we have to remember folks schools are sanctuaries for many students there are young people who their home lives are hell and school is a place where they can escape that temporarily with digital learning there is no escape they were trapped at home those were the models that we had used also speaking about students with disabilities accommodations for students with disabilities almost unilaterally this is in developing and developed countries like completely ignored when education shifted over to digital technologies these were students and learners that had been being served in school when it was an in-person physical and lived experience let's look at another promise edtech was meant to strengthen engagement achievement and outcomes this is what many people had touted about the digital technology would make learning more exciting and it would ensure better results and let me also say that when a lot of work went remote employers noticed that people were working longer hours a a sort of engagement with digital learning didn't seem impossible some people early on thought that people might spend more time on education than they had in schools but what does the evidence show people spend dramatically less time learning we did analysis on this at unesco in many countries students were spending on average less than 30 minutes a day on learning and educational tasks teachers in international surveys ranked the effectiveness of distance learning only slightly better than skipping school completely the longer the reliance on edtech the greater the rate of drop-off fallout disengagement from formal education and huge numbers did drop out and there is little chance that they will return to education it is the first time folks since big pushes around universal education that progress towards achieving universal education has dramatically declined i only have a little bit of time so i'm going to skip this these are for the the book it's meant to be a teaser but let me get to a concept that's very close to my heart and that is this one if there's one thing that people will tell you edtech is needed for now it's not necessarily to improve achievement it's not even needed to make education more interesting more engaging it's needed because education systems have to be resilient because folks we live in a dangerous world and there is another crisis right around the corner in which schools might have to close that's the pitch we should plan so that schools never close we went back and looked at what happened at the last global pandemic happened almost exactly a hundred years ago 1918 1919 influenza pandemic guess what was the great educational lesson that had been learned guess how long the school closures were very short why schools were understood to be centers of health what was the primary lesson that was derived from that experience it was to put a health care provider and a nurse inside every school it was to improve ventilation in schools it was to decrease class sizes what has our response been our response is we can close schools and now today around the world we're seeing all sorts of reasons that schools are closing totally unrelated to the pandemic it's because the streets are not safe it's because there's a mild weather event it's because we can't find enough teachers we need to protect what we have built over centuries over decades do not underestimate how much energy how much labor has gone into building our system of schools and teachers and places where young people can come together into a community of peers and learn to live together we should protect this and we should be very wary of the promises that are being sold to us about edtech i stop here i know that was not what people were expecting from an e-learning africa address i want to give credit to the organizers for having the courage to allow us to share some of these reflections and we look forward to working with all of you to find new directions for this digital transformation of education directions that do not bypass and go around schools but directions that include them we put forward some of these ideas in the global declaration on connectivity for learning and we again we look forward to drawing on your intelligence on your experiences to ensure that we change course and build a digital learning experience that is inclusive accessible and high quality for all thank you very much [Applause] my quick comment is mark could probably be a good priest or a pastor i don't know how many how many yeah would actually be able so thank you mark for your remarks i was reading a local coffee in a local coffee shop they were putting somewhere everything is questionable so i think that's what really mark is trying to say uh to tell us today um but the quick the most important thing i think is really a debate you know i think what i like from e-learning africa is really bringing bringing people from different background is always good so that they can really question some of the practices some of the policies and this does not really reduce the importance of technology i think we just need to question how we do things in a way that is critical i think that's really the point that mark and and probably many of you will be making during the uh the coming two days before uh inviting the second speaker let me acknowledge a few ministers that i see here and i'm so ready not to do it before i can see faces that i know so we have deputy minister from south africa here deputy minister welcome to yeah if you can just come up and then people see you she's the main deputy minister for basic education from south africa i see the minister from malawi welcome minister i see the minister deputy minister from sierra leone welcome minister so you guys can see women are dominating so yeah that's really great and i see deputy minister from zimbabwe mario welcome of course the minister of state from rwanda minister gaspar welcome is there any other minister that i may have missed i don't want to miss any are you a minister who so any minister that i have met oh wow ghana yeah please come up please come up i'm sure we can get she said yeah so the deputy minister from ghana welcome welcome to yeah so the second speaker is known as jerry she's a senior futurist uh research she researched the future she comes from the institute for future research at stellenbosch university in the stellenbosch business school in south africa her main focus is around leadership uh transformation equity and inclusion and i'm sure she will actually be alluding to some of the issues that mark uh came up with during uh during a speech and i'd like just to point out one critical issue that i wanted you to address jerry the three priorities around resilience and adaptability of the education system so if you can touch a bit on that it'll be very great so welcome welcome jerry good morning allow me to stand on all protocols observed and to express my absolute pleasure and honor to join you here at this e-learning africa conference 2022 after some difficult years with the covet pandemic wonderful to be connected and together again and let me also express my absolute honour and privilege to join such an esteemed group of panelists let me expand on some of the descriptions given by the previous speaker we're joined not only by academics but leaders thinkers shapers of africa's education futures my few remarks are intended to open the discourse and engagement space amongst ourselves here towards imagining multiple possibilities that could be realized in africa's education futures building on what the first speaker mentioned on history it's also important for us to build on the journeys already walked and the lessons learned and from here to envision new potential broader opportunities and to recognize that there are still obstacles to surpass and multiple constraints to address so in taking my cue from our chair albert i would like to share on some critical factors that are impacting education futures i'll reiterate a lot of what the previous speaker mentioned but i hope to add a bit more context so first i'll be speaking to the issue of access i'll also mention the issues of content and finally i will also speak to the issues of application importantly in discussing these critical factors impacting education futures i want us to reflect on some questions let us open the space for questioning and critical thinking where is education accessed mark has already begun to pinpoint some of the challenges in how we frame this question and how we respond to this question then which content is privileged as we sit here in kigali rwanda drawn from multiple different cultural contexts ourselves working in multi-disciplinary multi-sector areas which content do we focus on and privilege and finally what systems and support mechanisms exist for application when we think about our education futures so before i move into my remarks let me give some context first the united nations sustainable development goals offer us a wonderful framework from which to work from i will be focusing of course on unsdg4 but recognizing that all the goals are interrelated in one system of interdependency and therefore in addressing education for all inclusive and equitable quality education and promoting lifelong opportunities this is within the context of the full 17 goals of the unsdg next i also want to highlight the context of change that we are operating in now this is a key context for my few remarks on access content and application we've just come through the kovit 19 pandemic but from a futures perspective we are moving into an era of change rapid change exponential change and not only that but change that is very much defined also by crisis and we use the acronym vuca a lot which means that our world is increasingly shaped by volatility uncertainty complexity and ambiguity ambiguity meaning we are not sure where we're going or how we're going to get there then finally i am a futurist so i will be speaking from the context of strategic foresight or futures thinking which aims to provide tools that help us make sense of this vuca world so that we can better anticipate what can happen precisely towards taking meaningful impactful action so i'm at the institute for futures research we're based at stellenbosch university under the faculty of economic and management sciences in the business school the work we do is focus on growing qualified professional futurists who can deal with rapid change and complexity and create a desirable future i share this because we are the only academic institution that offers programs in future studies on the continent of africa future studies is a field that has been introduced formally to education from around the 1970s but increasingly we are arguing on advocating for future studies to be included as a core part of curricula we need to think long term deal with complexity and create the futures that we want which means exercising our agency then let me give you a few principles of futures thinking one to dispel misconceptions and also to curb any untoward expectations if i may quote from the founder director pro phillips piece we were established in 1974 he says that the ultimate purpose of future studies is not to predict the future its ultimate purpose is to create a desired future through better foresight development and better long-term decision making so in asking the questions here today i am not providing the answers i'm inviting us to engage collectively in thinking around how we can shape the futures that we wish for another key principle from future studies is the idea that there are different kinds of futures that are possible it is not a unidirectional linear trajectory from today to a given predetermined predefined future no there are also many different probable paths to the futures we want to create so we can allow ourselves to think broadly creatively imaginatively about what can be possible and in doing this we encourage broad thinking deep thinking thinking that questions and reframes so on that basis let's get into a few comments on those three critical factors i highlighted firstly on access i think the previous speaker has already shared a lot of what we need to consider around this particular critical factor but issues that are highlighted in terms of education futures we wish to build building on the un sdg for and the broader unsdg framework is accessed especially to those cohorts of our populations that have been ignored at the periphery and need to be intentionally included i mentioned here issues of gender and allow me to expand the definition of gender to include all the discussions the complex discussions around gender that we are beginning to have internationally and that are also beginning to be had on the continent of africa but also issues of disability then facilities as mark mentioned facilities are key especially when we think around futures of education what are the sites of learning and where will these be how will we ensure the infrastructures whether digital or physical are in place and are we putting measures into action now that will create futures in the next two three four generations are the facilities we're building looking to longer term futures and yes there's online learning but what does online learning mean for future generations in a world of digital inequity where we see a digital divide a key question i want to leave us with here as we move into other aspects of this conference are which sites of education are centered which ones do we believe should be centered and why let's move on to content remember i'm not providing answers i'm simply stimulating some thinking we know that when it comes to content the key issues when thinking around futures of education of course is relevance and quality and coming from south africa being within the higher education system there our student body is really pushing this conversation talking around transformation of the curriculum ensuring that learning speaks to the challenges of the youth today and that this learning is relevant and quality quality defined by the social impact and the innovative solutions that are proffered that are provided in terms of the challenges we face then of course the issue of stem and sciences technology engineering maths this is not something i believe can be avoided given that we can see in the world around us the fourth digital revolution uh the in the innovation around technology is is broadly broadly uh expanding across the world how do we ensure however that our stem education is experiential i.e connected to the experiences of our everyday lives and therefore speaking to questions of sustainability of impact and of course as we mentioned inclusivity and equity but let's not forget the arts so often especially in audiences where we're very focused on tech and digital and science the arts are increasingly important we need to think around how the arts and creative thinking build connection intergenerational connection intercultural connection connection across different languages where linguistics may fall apart what other forms of communication offered by the arts can we mobilize and therefore how can we use the arts and creativity to build relationships to our communities to our stakeholder groups and broadly across the different environmental and geographies that we occupy and finally the issue of empathy so that we know when we're delivering content when we are developing content that's relevant that's quality that looks at the stem subjects that includes arts that we also have empathy for the different perspectives that are represented by the multiple talents that humanity has to give us so can we create empathy in terms of the content that we are developing and the education futures that we're hoping to build because only in understanding the positionalities that we each occupy and the interdependencies that's how we will find solutions that speak to the systemic issues and finally let me move on to application of course we are in the midst of a digital transformation and this digital transformation is shaping new worlds of work at the business school we are confronted with this on a daily basis new worlds of learning e-learning digital learning but also learning as i mentioned that is located in different areas from the rural to the urban to space if we look into the futures so we are also looking at application of education for new worlds and of course when we think around the digital transformation and application and the rampant spread especially of social media that has created hyper connectivity amongst us we need to think around issues of reach and impact because application only in isolated privileged elite spaces is not an application that speaks to building new worlds or education futures that are inclusive equitable and accessible to everyone so colleagues let's think around how in building new platforms for application we are seeking to mend and build bridges rather than to deepen and create divides so how would i suggest we move forward from here what can our conversations cover in these next few days as we consult amongst ourselves build partnerships work towards collaboration i suggest we need new futures frames and in as much as we need to look at our history we need to look at our futures with new lenses let us expand our imagination let us also deepen and broaden our analysis of the challenges and the issues we face and finally i suggest we apply different lenses and lenses that we can learn from each other building on that relationship connectivity empathy and connection so let's move forward and as we talk about a new purpose for education question what we need to learn and unlearn what we need to reimagine as well as imagine afresh and finally what are the conducive policy and support mechanisms for this speaking to issues of leadership decision making and action let us welcome diverse approaches alternative approaches and expand our futures because there are multiple possible futures that are available to us and they start today with the agency and action that we put into place so colleagues as we open formally this e-learning conference 2022 i welcome you to work together into a future that we can create thank you so much [Applause] thank you thank you for welcoming us to the future i think it's a very interesting thank you jerry for your presentation um really setting stage of the coming two days discussion that we need to hear on top of technology how do we create the future we want i think that's the point of making and thank you for clarifying that you're not predicting the future you are really supporting to create the future i think it's a very important point to make thank you again i understand there's another minister that i forgot so there's a minister of niger here the minister of niger atc um [Applause] our next speaker is known as professor mogove ramos he is a philosopher and one of the key thinkers to help popularize the african philosophy especially specifically the the concept known as ubuntu the ubuntu philosophy he is a professor of philosophy focused uh primarily on ethics uh african philosophy and philosophy of law i had an earlier discussion with him because one of the things that we were looking at particularly in this opening sessions and to see the role of education to support the new african free trade area of course when we talk about trades we look at transactions we look at the all these things but on top there are also values that we need to share as a continent how do we value what we are producing uh as an africans i think that's also very important to take into consideration so professor ramos the flow is yours thank you [Applause
 good morning to you all that's what i did say and please allow me to convey my infinite gratitude to the organizers of this conference for me to participate i don't quite see well what i would like to read i don't know technology can there be some light here please this invitation brought me for the first time to rwanda one home of one of the giants of contemporary african philosophy namely alexis kagame okay um his magnum opus philosophy bantu rondez the length is still an important source in the elaboration of african philosophy of being or ontology i am also most thankful to you all for having chosen to participate in this conference by setting aside some of your commitments my topic is as follows a few grams of shaded gray and a coarse sand-like substance seem insufficient to demand ethics i propose to discuss this topic by focusing on one thesis i will speak to this thesis very briefly meaning there will be omissions there will also be gaps in my reasoning the thesis itself is divided into seven interconnected parts underlying the thesis is the argument that sensitivity to good and evil ought to translate into ethical reasoning and practice so the thesis is as follows the conquests of africa in the unjust wars waged by the arabs and the west have turned the indigenous peoples of the continent into a mother of soros a real martyr dolorosa yet africa is the precious mother the manta preciosa scintillating her ravishing beauty of being the irrevocable cradle of humankind i now proceed to identify the seven sorrows you will  put the numbers i will not say number one although they are number two number one the injustice of conquest in an unjust wall having penetrating and enduring effects ramified in the lives of the indigenous peoples of the continent this is what we see today this original unjustified violence divided the world into the colonized and the colonizer it was the first establishment of social distance with deadlier consequences than the social distance imposed by covet 19. the social distance of covet 19 is an appeal to ethical proximity to the other epistemic and social injustice is the second sorrow education for servitude ought to change into education for liberation can e-learning under the grip of capitalism deliver education for liberation number three i depart from my promise number three economic injustice manifesting in the deification of wealth and money adored by the structural systemic poverty and hunger this is the third sorrow after all the bottom billion is not an historical accident decolonization in the form of political independence only intensified the practice of epistemological dependency and economic bondage to the estwele colonial conqueror money as an ethical problem in western philosophy is traceable to its antiquity and is still alive in our time it is unethical for wealth or money to trump as it is continuing to do the human right of all human beings to the pluriversal collective ownership of mother earth the injustice of current dominant economic system lies precisely in its denial that mother earth is the bread basket the ontological panerium of all human beings including all that lives money is inserted as the decisive medium between life and death of all human beings having money is the seeming guarantor of the fulfillment of the right to life the inalienable right to subsistence having money having no money is the inevitable condemnation to abrupt or slow death including violent death sorrow number four is religious side and the superstition of economic bondage based upon the logic of baptism unborn future generations are subjected to compulsory baptism in the name of capitalism because of the original debt incurred by their forebears by this obligatory baptism a socio-economic system that is unjust at its root assures its continued existence i posed to make the point that my reference to religious side actually also emanates from the historical experience of conquest however i should like to make the point that an african christian roman catholic college man called saint augustine actually made the point that any religion that is with its salt should actually be ready to make a transition from the complacency of staying into the praying pain and we put into the fire of critical reasoning so no religion is above criticism we know that a lot of religions especially coming for the west have god in their package of theology what they call dogmatic theology and of course dogma is a barrier and a blockage to the quest for truth number five technological authoritarianism incorporating human beings into the community of useful robots now this is sort of number five elaborate little bit it is important to remember that the information and communication technology was originally confined to the military domain when it was extended to the civilian sphere the two pillars of military logic namely command and obedience continue to play the same role as they do in the military domain one of the effects of this is the replacement of kum komunikari kum from its latin root means with kum is with komu nikari speaking with so this speaking with is replaced with command from it is uber it is command what we have then is the locussio or the speech of the commander demanding obedience from the users of technology time is vital in this process because waiting for longer than the prescribed time results in the cessation of the activity or can result in the death of the soldier metaphorically speaking impatience and intolerance with the user emerge as some of the basic elements of this technology a technology without a human face it allows us to see the faces of others except its own face yet there is a face behind this technology the face of inhumane accumulation of wealth and profit making the time of this technology is ethically blind it is against the ethical dimension to time demanding humane courtesy to the other by communicating the expiry of the time allocated with patience and tolerance accordingly the proper name of information and communication technology is actually command locution so i'm going to kind of ellipses what we have is commando cushion it is technological authoritarianism here human beings are not only end users happy with a user-friendly technology we now are under the command of robotics turning us into useful members of the community of robots for those of us who were in concurrent south africa under a different political hit we are not surprised command locution is not new at all we used to hear muni tenkni dun vadex translate that don't think do what i say you better command so you see locution is not new to us it is a problem from an ethical point of view against the spectrum like to remind us that it was quasi we redo also one of the giants in the time of alexis agami one of the giants in african philosophy who made the point that it would profit us in africa very little if we were to discard the humanist principles and absorb wholesale and and critically what technology can offer well we go to sorrow number six law that is foreign in its own land ought to remedy this travesty of justice african law on its own terrain is actually foreign this is incompatible that is why nkrumah refers to it as a tragedy of justice the practical dominance and supremacy of the law of the colonial conqueror in the new states of africa is a gross violation of natural justice in fact when this point was recalled in the un conference which was held in durban well it was it was just not to be discussed it did not have to come to the table in 1994 when conquerors south africa ascended to a new political dispensation next door in kampala there was a conference held in april 1994. the theme of the conference is more revealing it was a conference on reparations to africa the very theme that law in its own country may not be foreign applies also to the languages of africa again at this point we remember and recognize alexis gagami's monumental work on the consanguinity of african languages it is work complemented by isaac's argument that the proto-afro-asiatic language may well have been the original language of humankind okay i wrap up we we we stand in gratitude of the african union today for having recognized kiswahili as one of its official languages sorrow number seven and the last one i will skip the incorporation of copyright law into the organization for the harmonization of business law in africa and francais ohada is epistemic subservience destroying communal knowledge as one of the basic elements of african ethics and this is the message of the philosophy of ubuntu the seven sorrows of mother africa is actually the message of the philosophy of ubuntu i will skip the conclusion thank you very much thank you thank you professor mugabe in the dedication for servited ought to change to education for liberation thank you for for conveying the message um let me now introduce the uh hosts the minister of education from rwanda dr valentine our maria let me again thank you for making your time in several other issues that you are sorting out on a daily basis having spent time with us is really great a quick introduction before minister joined her current position she went through you know i think i was impressed to see your cv i did not realize uh you have been at the university of rwanda you did chemistry then to university of vitz in south africa again chemistry science and then to university of delft in the netherlands she studied water science and environmental technology when she came back home she had worked for the university of rwanda as a professor dean of science in the faculty in the college of science and technology she was also before she joined the ministry deputy vice chancellor of the rwanda polytechnic you know responsible for training institutional development and research so very impressive cv so i'm happy that we have you here you understand the challenge better than anyone that you are facing i had an opportunity to meet the minister during the kobe 19. i remember the first few months and in her office and i remember she was talking about she was very much engaged in building 20 000 classrooms in about i think she had about three to six months so very impressed to to hear that and i was wondering if she was expecting chinese or i don't know some of these construction companies by the way she was actually working with the army working with the police with the communities to build those schools so that's quite impressive i thank you minister again let me just welcome you to make the opening remark thank you [Applause] thank you so much albert honorable ministers honorable deputy ministers my colleague honorable minister of state honorable cabinet secretary and delegates distinguished distinguished speakers exhibitors ladies and gentlemen good morning once again i want to correct a bit i didn't construct schools it was done by the community by the government so but i gained some knowledge in construction during that period so i'm a half-baked engineer now in construction so thank you so much i would like to express my gratitude to e-learning africa and partners for their dedication to annually prepare the e-learning africa conference which is taking place in african countries on a rotation basis and now it is our turn here in rwanda i'm delighted that the theme for this 15th international conference and exhibition on ict for education training and skills development is a new purpose for education i recognize it is essential that we increase our efforts in this regards given the turbulence the the turbulence caused by convine 19. the panemic has had tremendous socio-economic consequences in all countries of the world while remote learning solutions were easier to implement in developed countries with the necessary infrastructure in place school closures and continuous learning have posed a much bigger challenge in african countries distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen rwanda has placed great importance on improving the access and quality of its education this is formulated in our country's vision of 2015 as well as in associated implementation plans such as the national strategy for transformation nst-1 and the education sector strategic plan essp ronda's overreaching goal for the social transformation pillar of the national strategy for transformation that is for five years seven years from 2017 to 2024 is to develop rwandans into a capable and skilled people with quality standards of living and a stable and secure society by ensuring quality of education for all aiming at building a knowledge-based economy education is a key sector for this social and economic transformation we need to focus on equipping our young people with the digital skills they need to enable them to be prepared for the social economic development of our country based on technology this will not only include the need for a strong emphasis on digital literacy in our education systems with a focus on collaborative learning and problem solving but also for young people to be flexible and adaptable it requires the transfer of soft skills such as critical thinking problem solving and creativity furthermore ronda has chosen to place ict at the core of our education delivery chain because we believe in its power to improve teaching and learning and contribute to the quality of education we want i'm delighted therefore to see the hosts of topics included in this conference's agenda coupled with the multitude of skilled experienced people in the area of e-learning and digital transformation who have been able to attend this important meeting i know this can only have a profound effect effect on the development of our education systems not only in the work of the impact caused by providing 19 but also given the new challenges which are being brought about as a result of our increasingly digital economies and the fourth industrial revolution the comprehensive nature of this e-learning conference is illustrated by the many parallel sessions being held both today and tomorrow ranging from topics such as digital development of soft skills in our schools public and private sector partnership on education technology in schools lessons learned from a rapid conversion of courses to a fully online format strengthening capacities at african universities for quality and equitable higher education learning boosting teachers digital literacy challenges teaching online during challenges of teaching online during convine 19 pandemic i have only picked six examples from the very many sessions taking place during this meeting i believe numbering around 60 in all but i have seen that they are very relevant and essential to support our education systems and communities as we embrace the challenges faced to meet our shared goals ladies and gentlemen the conference will surely be an opportunity to promote the use of ict for improving access to relevant information education and training in africa but also to support sustainable education solutions in order to drive economic and social prosperity of our respectively our respective countries recognizing education as a critical investment for future growth and development in our respective countries letters leverage from e-learning africa conference to pave their way through the establishment and strengthening of collaboration within edited ecosystem as we strive towards more resilient education systems i'm certain that you will all benefit immensely from this conference and you will enjoy your time in rwanda a country of thousand hills but also a thousand smiles i'm therefore pleased to officially open this conference and wish all of you a fruitful meeting i thank you for your kind attention [Applause] thank you thank you honourable minister uh valentine for the the opening speech now it's time for break we have about 15 minutes delay but i think we can adjust accordingly so i'm going to encourage participants to visit the stunts the exhibitions uh areas i'm sure they are very good opportunities and engagement with the different exhibitors thank you again for attending the opening thank you  you
it really it's really pretty simple there's an app on the phone you open it up it will propose music to you you can download anything you would like you get samples of that music and really importantly you've got something called gig finder which uh uses the gps on the phone to locate you and tells you hey um xyz band is playing um you know at sort of the pub up the road or at the fmp stadium or at the dome it's a great way of finding out who's doing what around you so so that that's adaptable worldwide in terms of the gig finder that's absolutely that's the smart thing about it that fixes on the phone gps knows where you're on it makes it relevant to you wherever you are absolutely fantastic right tell me more we've got a few more minutes so you can maybe bring up some other ones as well well yeah i mean i've uh so you know you know if we look at some broad categories so uh as i said i'm a bit of a wildlife and tourism uh junkies so i spent quite a lot of time in the bush so i load up on photography apps um i i load up on something uh on cecil e birds which uh you know um i guess you know for us as people who like you know being in the bush you want to know what bird you're looking at you want to know what animal you're looking at so i've got cecily birds e-wildlife field guides mammals e-snakes if you're into that kind of thing i know not not everyone is there's some amazing local action i think that's one area where we've done really really well is supporting the local ecosystem it's all very well having uh having apps at work overseas but but what you want is you want to be able to find wi-fi around you free wi-fi so there's a great app called find free wi-fi which does exactly that but it does it for south africa um of course we've got super sport we've got dhtv uh you know if you own one of those little drifter um jobbies that that broadcasted the std signal you can get it on your phone uh we've just launched an amazing app uh the saki mtv app which does mountain bike trails so you can go and go and dive down down the side of the cliffs and on your mountain bike using that app and achieve it right what about somebody asked a question what about an app that helps your budget oh there's some there's some really great finance finance apps so you know they're a plethora of finance apps that you can download onto the phone and and many of them do exactly that so if you go into the finance section on the store you'll find a whole pile of apps like that and also you'll get some apps that give you really good advice so we've got a an amazing bloomberg app we've got um bing finance so you can track the jsc where you know where the json closed um there's there's for example a paypal app which allows you to send send money securely um to to people using the very very popular paypal service so yeah there's an entire category of financial apps that allow you to do personal finance planning um and and of course you know the world's most uh fourth most popular accounting systems excel and that ships through on the device a lot of people actually use that all right we've got about uh 20 seconds more to go if people need to find out more about all things nokia i mean just give me a contact number or website i can lead them on to triple w nokia dot here dot za and uh follow follow f machine rsa on twitter and fro and of course we've got our facebook page which is uh slash nokia rsa as well okay lots to think about that's where we're going to leave it thank you so much for your time appreciate it
 African Bible colleges dedicated students push ahead with their education online during the corvette 19 shutdown practically overnight our faculty transition their courses to google classroom so students across the continent could continue learning our ABC students many of whom come from rural areas where internet or even electricity is not available face numerous challenges very few have laptops and even fewer have access to Wi-Fi so they rely on their phones to download assignments some do all the work on their phones while others write up their papers by hand take pictures and email them back to their professors students at ABC are continuing with their education despite the many difficulties that they face like not having laptops internet sometimes even electricity but ABC was to change that the goal of the college is for every student to have a laptop which is essential during their study time and will be a key part of their lives when they graduate in the different workplaces and ministries ABC has a sum total of 700 students in it three in his three campuses in Malawi Liberia and Uganda h student laptop will cost three hundred and fifty dollars this is a lot but with your help ABC can make it happen thank you for making a gift towards the purchase of a laptop per student each donation will be greatly appreciated by a hard-working well deserve a student here at ABC you

hi guys this is smiley Jason from smile and mobile now we already told you about the explosion of mobile technology all across Africa so today we decided to highlight some of the apps that are Making Waves all across the continent in a new African app review series okay so the first app we're going to review in the African app series is an app called EO EO is a mobile social quiz platform that allows students to log on take quizzes and share their results with their friends the top performers will show up in the leaderboard and you can log on to see how you rank against other students in the country this app came out of Nigeria one of the good things about it is it is available on a lot of older phones which is very necessary when you're developing apps for the African Market let's get started so first of all we click on the play button so remember we told you this app came out of Nigeria you see three different levels here ss1 SS2 ss3 these are just High School levels it's like grade 10 11 and 12 in the United States so it's very simple we'll just select one of the levels here let's maybe select ss3 is the equivalent of grade 12 here in the United States there's different subjects you can cover maybe we want to look at physics So within physics choose a topic let's say uh musical instruments then it will take you to the music instruments quiz page and then you can start taking this quiz and there is a timed quiz so the moment we click start the timer will start so we're going to click Start right now and there you go the timer has started as you can see down at the bottom we have 9 minutes and 31 seconds over here what you basically do is you just answer the question it will take you on to the next question at the end you will see your results and you can share it on Facebook we'll just click through cuz we have no idea what the answer to these things are all right so there you go we through to the end and our score was 10 because we got a grand total of one question right uh so yeah physics not a strong point here but you see it's a very great thing to do you can share this on Facebook on this page you can also take another quiz over here so we think this is a great app it's fun educational available on multiple platforms and serves a really good purpose in countries all over Africa and that's why it's SMA mobile we're going to give this app four stars so in our first African review app series the app EO gets four stars from Smiler mobile
hello my name is abdul karim sesnega and i'm from new mountains learning advisors and my name is heading for the rules i'm also from three mountain studios for me as i like ict so i want to be in icd things but also but also to to explore and to have skills and things that i need so that i can contribute something to my e-learning field that's why okay perfect okay and as a company as street mountains learning advisors we have started a soft skills academy so there's online learning and then there's face-to-face teaching or online teaching we have a booth and we're here to look for as many partners as possible and maybe allison is a possible partner to share our courses with for me uh the future of ilani it is developing as you can see now we we are in the illini africa and somehow it is too big than the last year which means that it is improving and also if i can say we are throwing papers away so maybe in the next few years things will go digitally you know full full digitally and i think for all people can can try to like it and try to contribute something to it and i think one of the great challenges for africa is content content that's local because many eu learning is made united states i don't know where and often there's an issue with it's like not me if it's africa and the other issue is connectivity like we're now in rwanda we're in the capital it seems very nice but in reality in rural areas people are still not connected don't have enough commands of english and are not able to follow so the digital divides like the heads and the head nodes that is a big issue i think for me if i'm going to say about addison i don't know much about alison but i think this is great for me okay and i think i look briefly at the courses and it has the problem of not me and there's no african section so it's about like relating to the to the to the content so i'd advise you to start like special section for africa with local content right
   education in Africa today stands below the standards set by global benchmarks with me are one of the pioneers of online education in the African space Dahlen seeks to connect 50 million students to online education by the Year 2022 hello guys is great to have you here laughs Raqqah the internet penetration is below 50% according to reports the for example have internet yes and I want to have each tgf-beta Commission several of the crappy and cannot have it cannot watch videos help us so what we've done is to one take our videos make it move out first so that you know people coming on coming out of my wife also works perfectly and you know talking about the what what to say about mom and you want to be connected because waffle think it is cheaper cheaper this much for it's just much much like this the Technos I get a chip as cheaper someone more people will have access to this easily and while you need to have it just you know have the same time there whether you need to do 30 connection we love meals they were working on those connections because of the compression that we see it seems to do without compression you can't have five hours of planning for about the cost of the text message they may trigger that is you know because able to bring me just down to you one megabyte for every power so that is very cheap so what courses do you offer where don't learn we've initially partnered with the company here in Legos to offer courses for the bike in the gem and will be soon working on some the other we're focusing on secondary level education courses the basic ones math physics English so don't learn started first in Ghana the expansion is Africa right yeah starting in Ghana so how did when you first ventured into ghandahar did get me ins react to don't learn well Ghana was was interesting when you talk about the our our first path market which was the Wieck and they call it the waspey over there they already have this established system for students who pass us or don't pass the exam the first time that they take it so for example if you take the exam in in in form 3 and you don't pass then the system of schools called remedial schools and so our first major competitor the option from which we were trying to take students away from the idea and log existing solutions and try to convince them to adopt a digital solution were these were these were these big schools but I think the main advantages of our platform are the advantages of any kind of online solution but especially so thanks to our technology which is that it provides us it provided you know our first few students with a option that was much much much cheaper than paying for example I think it was their students who pay a two hundred thousand IRA a term to attend one of these schools to prepare for you know the next upcoming exam and that's more money than many students have have access to so if we come and say you know we can provide you the same exact you know the same exact quality of education for maybe 5000 naira a year and it's interactive you get personalized attention you get it's convenient it's on your phone you don't need to take the the down flow you don't need to take the bus to the school it was an attractive value proposition to a lot of students who couldn't afford the existing alternatives and that's why you know the exam these exams are a very high pressure for our students and that was one of the things that there were students who were skeptical about using their phones to study I think anytime you try to introduce something new there will be skeptics and doubters but the exam was high pressure enough and the value proposition of easily accessible and affordable online learning in your phone was was good enough that we were able to definitely can you know we were able to convince you know our first you know ten thousand users to actually try this and use us and it's been pretty good so far this is that it's as affordable as five thousand now a year so si per course so did you envisage any challenges at all coming into the niger market maybe coming into the african space you know for our idea of making online education or macmillan education more accessible are some of the main questions were even if you know everyone had a library of all of the nicest online courses you know the best teachers in the world making the best online courses for every student right at the fingertips of every single student in Ghana or Nigeria would they still with students here still find value in it and how and why in if if so you know then the other assumptions are you know what they trust a mobile phone with a trusted computer - - yeah exactly and these are things that for example you know on a very very human level for example if you are using our platform to study for an exam say the work or the gym and you didn't pass this exam the first time right if you're using it to restarting for this exam which is what a number of our students are using our app to study for and you know you're a parent and you come home and your child hasn't passed the exam and you tell them you need to study for the exam for a better next time so that you can pass you can get into university and you come home and you see your child on their phone and you get mad because you know you think that you see your child on your phone and he's on what's up he's on Facebook wasting is time until you yell at them you take their phone away and you give them a book and these are the kinds of things that we knew we might run into and and we have and for all of these questions of getting into sort of the market or the general African market Ghana we had chosen as our first place to start figuring out these questions before we moved on to Nigeria which is significantly larger in terms of the market size I think the other the other issue in terms of expanding and problems that that that we have had expanding and will have expanding is payment solutions because you know our app has a subscription and students can pay through a variety of means but the forms of digital payment are different in different countries and so you know if we were doing this in say Kenya it would be super easy with them pizza and things like that but you know in Ghana to have this mobile payment solution where mobile money everyone has you know the major networks there MTN Airtel you can sign up for Mobile Money account and and that that is made it possible for students to pay though it's not it's still not a perfect solution since maybe only 30 percent of our customers or 30 percent of the students that we've talked to have a mobile money account before you know before they download our app so that made things easier to start out in Ghana and then moving to Nigeria that's been one of our biggest challenges is you know there isn't that perfect of a payment system that just exists out of out of the door you know we have a bunch of different options that we're we're currently using right now but it's definitely not as easy as it could be so I'm school we have to think about that wind isn't in school because almost all of our users have not every use anything oh I didn't know what should we do if no was do if these are needed to blend before they're washed videos you know 20 videos and all that I'm like is a fun to learn is a computer to life so one of the things that we will do is to actually give them a chance to to experience it right so we try to make as much as possible the Istrian subclass or the ad list or enter class or you have a teacher teaching you concept before intersecting examples introducing to you how to you know the type of problems and all that but also you know recommending what you should be learning you know how you go in way when you taking the tests on the app you know so given you a very very comprehensive experience so and also we you know give me time to transport for after delivery so we give everybody two weeks just for then whatever you want for two weeks and then I love you see it said above so the feedback you get two people kind of prefer the online learning I wouldn't describe it as people prefer one or the other I'd rather I would say that there's different kinds of people and the students that we've had I guess in the in text speak we call them early adopters these are the kids who are a bit more adventurous with technology than you know the general average population and you know our feedback among like those students has been fantastic and that's definitely a good sign as we work towards making this more sort of open and appealing to the in all the general student population for whom you know they're not as willing to you know they didn't want to see confirmation from other people that that this is good this is works before they're willing to try it out themselves though I think the other thing that's helped us is as I mentioned the the high pressure of the exam and the cost of other alternatives has has made some state just those two factors have made students willing to give us a try and and that's sort of given us a to hold in the market into those first you know a more adventurous students who then you know as we expand our off as we improve our service will then you know show by example with other students we've had students recommending the app to their friends already and I think that for us is you know essentially our plan for bringing it to the entire student population in general by leveraging those you know referrals as recommendations hey I like this I have that's good that you should try it to make it more appealing to the whole student population you talk about expansion so it's nothing now to expand to West Africa well I think I would talk about what we're going to do before where we're going to do it for us you know we know we're very conscious of the fact that we ourselves and are as good as our team of seven our or our employees are they you know we cannot by ourselves you know change online education everywhere in you know in Africa and in the world as well so we know that at some point we're going to need to marry our technology with the expertise the education the the content the business know-how of others of partners whether and when that's that happens say in South Africa or Kenya or Ivory Coast I'm I think it's a little bit early days right now right now we're focused still on making sure that we get our operations right here in in in West African Ghana and Nigeria and as for example our technology it becomes a bit more stable as online education has to become a thing as we've finalized our partnerships with the the companies that were currently working with here for example working with tacos then those hopefully will provide us with our bridge for example I you know go to other places as well how can students access don't learn it's an Android app if you go to the Play Store right now you can search em school that's and then lower case and then school and you'll find our app additionally we have a web site coming soon so if you check maybe you know sometime in the next month or two you'll see a web version of our software as well where you can take the or the videos on your without with that downloaded the app and that would be at M school XYZ thank you guys so much for coming for my interviews are the trending business news please visit www.canadianoutback.com and connect with us on linkedin thank you so much for watching 
  so some teachers before they do not know how even to use the the machine so at least we have seen even the teachers have learned they're able now to type the work so you even the teachers have learned how to use to be ICT lit I feel more motivated because there before we used to use charts but now we are using computers we can type our work we have moved actually from from analog to digital they get like access they learn pump them like here this is the new technology yeah it's the future you know and they'll be f everywhere they go uh we have a total of 48 schools and at the moment we have only roll out in five schools so we are hoping that we'll be able to equip the 48 school and more schools in the county we'll start small but we are hoping that we'll grow big we still don't have a policy of ew so end competing has really helped us in that way cuz you not have many machine to dispose so it has really helped us in many ways if one give me 30 minutes to install everything the operating system the vspace software the licensing the activation of that Gadget but for the whole Lab Give Me 2 hours love done cuz I only work on the host machine so I would say the main benefits are reduction in the budget of computer technicians as well as power savings and theft of computer theft of computer accessories has also reduced so we are quite happy with that we are supposed to create around 60 seats computer seats to do a training somewhere we did uh a saving of around 47% which is equivalent to around $2,000 us we're very thankful to the people who have who have given us this computers and may God bless them thank you i' like to say thank you thank you very much thank you very much thank you very much to the end Computing team and uh for this technology that uh you brought our way we are happy to be your partners  but
foreign the largest portion of South Africa's budget is spent on education over 252 billion Rands yet many experts believe that the country's education system is in crisis with the world economic Forum ranking South Africa 140th out of 144 countries in terms of the quality of State education there are so many challenges that teachers and principals have to face for example the threat of gangsterism is it really has a negative impact on on education we also have extreme poverty where kids come to school hungry and that also has an impact on and obviously a negative impact on how kids can concentrate in class so the crisis I believe can be overcome with if correct measures are put in place but there is a crisis via Africa is an educational publishing house that has been producing textbooks for almost 60 years to appeal to the digital generation the company has decided that all the books from grades 4 to 12 be brought out in electronic versions with enhanced content okay what we've looked at is Learners want more than just a paper page and we already had lots of books in the market but too many Learners didn't have access to the enhanced content that we had so we looked at the possibilities of how do you make learning more interesting more interactive and we came across the augmented reality app by layer and we decided to call it living Pages what it does is the learner can point a smartphone add a picture on certain pages in our books and get to watch a video listen to a poem read to them and actually experience what's happening rather than just looking at some of the page the living pages and test yourself applications are available for free download on Android and Apple devices the apps make use of augmented reality technology to make the textbooks come alive I think the first thing is it's magic and it is Magic you point your phone at a page you tap it something happens the page squiggles a little and then all of a sudden you're listening to a voice reading a poem that you're looking at or you're watching a video and in our experience people are quite gobsmacked at it because it is that magic and what that's going to do for us I think is it allows the learner the opportunity to experience more there's only so much you can put into a book and so many Learners have books rather than electronic media for everything so the teacher can take advantage of that in order to be able to excite the class enhance the learning Monique Peterson is a grade 10 learner at Nord de Paul high school and finds using the mobile app far more stimulating than conventional classes yes it's quite exciting the new app I saw it for the first time this year and it's quite exciting the app is quite interesting I've learned a lot and it's part of my school work and so I get to know what well via Africa see mobile technology playing a key role in improving both the access and quality of Education in South Africa I think mobile technology is critical because it's a la it allows people to have access on a small scale rather than saying well let's put in computer labs into every classroom and see what we can do in their mobile technology give them an opportunity to be using the smartphone that they've inherited from their parent as people upgrade it means that they're able to interact with books it means you can stream content to them a whole lot easier and quickly and it means that eventually I think when Departments of Education are on board they're going to be able to interact with the Learners and teachers far quicker than via the old send out the textbooks wait for them the lack of quality education in South Africa severely undermines the poor and the country's economic growth via Africa's goal is to provide a high level of Education that is easily accessible with offline digital textbooks and learning apps the company also produces a Mobi reader app which allows teachers and Learners to download their educational material in ebook format
my name is mike ferrick i'm the ceo and founder of allison allison is one of the largest pre-learning platforms in the world we're particularly large in africa what attracts most learners to allison is that we're completely free nearly up 5 000 courses and you can study and graduate without paying anything and that's we also have services for for businesses where we have free lms where a company can go on and create courses and assign them to people and get detailed reports and again there's no cost how that works is that we work like facebook and google we work on advertising if you want to not have the advertising you pay but if you're okay with the advertising it's entirely free and because we have millions of people on the platform it generates significant income and allows us to provide it for free and the important thing is we're we're a for-profit social enterprise so our main our main goal is social impact the main thing that attracts people in africa is the fact that it's free and we're strongest in countries where there's english language we are working in a swahili version and for instance we did courses on kovid where we actually adapted a covet course to 20 different african languages so we've done it before and we're just expanding that so that's on its way and the other thing is that we have a free publishing tool which allows anybody anywhere to go on and create their own courses so we're particularly interested in finding people in africa who have their own content because even though we provide project management at a universal level or any type of courses even on agricultural courses the industry for say specifically here in rwanda or nigeria or south africa may be maybe different so through our sub publishing our self publishing tool people can create their own courses and publish for free so that they're the people that they want to learn those courses can actually then access afterwards and access those content and certify for free well i think e-learning and edtech generally is this phenomenal opportunity in africa uh five years ago i visited nigeria we did not have one allison employee in africa now we have over 50 and i think that actually in the years ahead we're going to the majority of the allison employees worldwide are actually going to be based in africa we have a big note of publishers in nigeria a lot of our marketing's done out of south africa and we hired our first engineers in nigeria in the last couple of weeks and also we're looking at expanding a center in kampala there's a lot of engineering talent in africa it's new but it's getting it's coming and uh we find it as a great opportunity so i i think we can see that not only is allison providing new learning opportunities to so many people in in africa and more people are getting online but actually the infrastructure behind it and particularly with behind allison is becoming more african by the day and uh that's very exciting for us and i think for africa you
now is the time when technology can really help to accelerate the progress many African countries have made in education Spirit of of creativity is going to be explosive in Africa co-organized by the African Union commission and hosted by the government of Ethiopia the 10th anniversary of e-learning Africa returned to the city in which it was first launched at is Ababa Ethiopia it's Africa's eye opener it's progressing diverse views Pana African great experience in May 2 15 1,389 political leaders policy makers leading experts entrepreneurs Educators practitioners researchers Business Leaders and innovators from 68 countries met at the African Union headquarters to share experiences and discuss the role technology can play in Africa's economic growth and development my recommendation is for those investors to look look out to these kids young people who have uh all the creativity and support them to grow the young people uh are hungry for knowledge they're curious they want to learn they want to discover they want to invent they don't want to do the things in the old way they want to embrace development and actually transformation I get to meet people from across the continent uh coming in and and talking about different Industries and what inspires them and what what they want to do uh you know futuristic kind of Outlook to see and improve uh the problems that they have in their own count stimulated by 249 International speakers participants took part in the kind of dialogue that's transforming the continent the most valuable thing about e-learning Africa is really the people you've got people here inventing really the future of learning the future of the people of Africa and that's exciting to see the passion and to see the creativity and to see The Innovation looking at the past and getting guidance from that in order to determine what our future should be not T from outside by by Africans and for Africans in the e-learning Africa exhibition 32 International exhibitors showcase the latest products and services on offer whilst participants were kept entertained and made lasting connections at live performances exclusive launches networking receptions Awards ceremonies and other special events I noticed that there are so many tools that we learned about during this event about how we can use technology today as the continent's Education and Training landscape is changing at a rapid Pace e-learning Africa provides the vital keys to understanding the changes happening now that can affect the lives of future Generations e-learning Africa 2015 enriching tomorrow we would like to thank our sponsors and supporters
foreign  the content and Publishing director for learn Africa PRC land Africa PLC was incorporated in 1961 as long by Nigeria it became learn Africa PLC in 2012 when the largest shelter then diverted that is piercing education diversity out of Longman Nigeria our main business is publishing distribution marketing of educational titles at all levels of Education pre-primary primary junior secondary senior secondary and the tertiary levels of Education my name is Christopher and I'm the head of sales Lagos and West how will I read the educational University for me the education sector in Lagos State have set the pace for education in Nigeria and most especially for the digital education because the digital education is the future of education and I see Lagos scaling the pace of this digital education in the next 10 years in Nigeria let Africa's rule in the Lagos State ebook project was to provide access to curriculum compliance books the books are also written in line with the legal stage scheme of work such that it's to be easier for the teachers to to use in the books what we have provided in the ebook platform this time around we have embedded additional values like videos audios and additional meanings to the books such that it will make learning more enjoyable it will make teaching efficient for the Learners and their teachers doing something differently with regards to this project for me we have done everything we need to do as it concerns the project we have delivered optimally as expected by the Lagos State government with regards to the project all I beg all I seek from the government is to improve the numbers of subject areas to be covered so that students in Lagos can have more learning outcome and experience from the usage of our enhanced textbooks let Africa PLC has a very wide distribution Network we are 16 offices Nationwide apart from the head office that is based in Lagos we also have sales representatives in all the states of the Federation in some states we have two we have three reps uh you know so it's a very wide distribution Network and very effective on behalf of learn Africa PLC I would like to say a very big thank you to the governor of the state it's Excellency for his deep interest in education which he has displayed by making education in Lagos State's contemporary we also have to say a very big thank you to the commissioner for Education Mrs folashade Ade visaya for a motherly role for interest in ensuring that the Lagos State child becomes better educated we also wish to thank the minister of Education team the curriculum services department and all others for the wonderful role they have played in making sure that this becomes a huge success
next up we're checking in with a group with an ambitious plan to solve at least some of the nation's education problems through technology ma valley has the story the issues around South Africa's education system are always contentious and cry out for solutions technology can help solve this and is easily implemented in a fluid schools but what about in impoverished areas via Africa have launched a new initiative to help solve this problem through digital solutions via Africa have been developing educational materials for over 60 years four years ago they partnered with the Nelson Mandela Foundation to roll out library containers to some of the most underprivileged schools in South Africa these libraries include books and also provide librarian training and have more recently been converted into digital education centers each of these digital centers are supplied with 15 Android tablets containing the latest educational programs apps and electronic books on any subject Under the Sun via Africa also provides free Wi-Fi to each of these centres the first of these digital centres was launched in april 2014 and are currently running in three schools in limpopo boo malanga and the free state by Ithaca believe strongly that it's time for us in South Africa to move away from just purely paper books we need to move to a digital world and e-learning is quite critical for us so the idea of taking digital materials like tablets with various apps i electronic books and putting them into schools gives us the opportunity to experiment to see what happens if you take a rural school and all our digital centres I rural schools and see what exactly will happen and teachers are given the training window given the opportunity to work with digital materials to see what happens my Africa also released ve learning in South Africa report which reveals amongst other things that the majority of provinces six out of nine to be precise believe their schools are not ready for digital learning interestingly this report also shows that in all but three provinces one hundred percent of schools have the appropriate buildings for digital solutions the report looked into factors such as electricity supply in school buildings as well as attitude towards information and communications technology in fact eight out of nine of our provinces show the attitude towards digital solutions is a positive one challenges in South Africa in terms of e-learning we see it are twofold the first is the easier hurdle to get over and that's teacher training too few teachers are trained and I think that there needs to be a great deal more training in terms of you learning pedagogy rather than what's happening that the number of companies are just give a set of tablets or give some computers there's not enough training about how to develop the period EG then secondly as money and i don't think we can expect that the government's going to provide that money magically and we feel the company that good private public partnerships are the way to go because by doing that we label to get more kids in front of tablets and computers the battle that by as we can find themselves in is that there are a lot of misconceptions around the idea that digital maybe the answer to the crises South Africa's education system faces so they're also using these digital centers as a case study project to see if they'll be suitable Martha can believe that you can't just fly in and drop down something and in fly away and hope elearning is going to take place I think too many things that have happened in that country have been organisations going into a school saying oh yes 20 tablets and then disappearing our goal is that we'll be able to work over the next many years as we develop many products these schools will get the benefit on them for as we do additional training there will be the people that we're going to pile it on so what we're building our centers of excellence in each of these three provinces so that we can have them as a referral base but also that the teachers and the schools can grow from there they are confidence that these digital centers will be able to prove that when properly implemented digital solutions can make massive inroads into fixing some of the problems in our education system

constraints yeah yes Bo is that I I agree po Network yeah large large classrooms yeah I know some of us have over 200 students in one class that be challenging yeah yes Nina large classrooms it appears everyone is saying large classrooms today I teach adults okay the main concern is the absence okay translation native beautiful yes okay thank you very much for your comments please keep them coming afterwards we would coate all your your comments and see how we can um Pro profile solutions to them if we if we unpreparedness of students yeah very good thank you so let's look at the next slide and see some of the things that um our friend CH GPT thinks about um the concerns in subsaharan Africa so I asked my friends at GPT to tell me some of the concerns that we have in subsaharan Africa and here's a list that we have infrastructure access to Quality education um access to education itself teacher shortages PR gender inequality and so on and so forth and I asked what can we do about it and this is what chuty said invest in infrastructure uh increase access improve teacher training curriculum enhancement address poverty promote gender inequality and so on and so forth now these are ideas that chg has provided and think about it what can you do what can you do about these concerns so what I'm trying to do now is to do some advocacy for um you know making the system better and thanks to British Council we're enjoying something about teacher training now um this series that we've had for a while now on ICT is another intervention by British Council in col collaboration with teacher associations so you in your little corner you're doing something and that's why you here on this platform today to learn a thing or two about maximizing over apps for um El context so um Clos to everyone who has joined in or who will watch the video afterwards um you're developing and you're helping um teaching in subsaharan Africa and we we pray that as you continue in these efforts things will get better in your context now there's something again that I would like us to see um about the context that we are talking about today subsaharan Africa and that will be in the uh in the area of Statistics so can we go to the next slide let's talk about the statistics that we have um about the usage of mobile phones um here is a statistical record published um in 20223 by um one of the leading um mobile phones and mobile um systems in in Africa called GSM um let me get the name now um just um okay um Global Systems for mobile Communications GS gmsa in 2023 now these um statistics that we can see on screen shows that we have many mobile phones or people have access to the internet now in in Nigeria South Africa Egypt Kenya Ethiopia and some other subsaharan African countries what this means to us is that um The Narrative is not as gloomy as many of us think that um people are not connected via the Internet people are getting connected and um they also project that in by 2025 over 615 million um people would have been connected to the internet and about 75% of that number will be on uh to be on the internet using smart phones or en internet enabled devices so it's not really a situation um things are changing and I'm sure if I inquire from you um you will tell me some things about the the nature of your um teaching context so now we would like to share a poll with with you like you to tell us what you what you think um about these questions and this would help us to kick start the conversation for today um is our pool ready Gary do we have our pool ready yes so here's the poll um as an English teacher do you make use of mobile devices in your classroom okay this is the second poll we're supposed to be having having the first one but it's fine um you can answer these ones and then you can answer the first one as well um when it is done um I can see the responses coming up um as a teacher do you make use of mobile phones mobile devices the classrooms I can see the answers are interestingly the affirmative the second question um are your students allowed to use mobile phones in your school classroom and we can see um we see more answers no no no no so all right okay can we have the first one can we have the first fold can we have the first poll Gary yes guys com in okay okay let me let me go see where I [Music] can okay

just move to um the next good so can you type um in the chat what you know about smartphones I know you're using one already uh but let's know how well you know your smartphones what do you know about smartphones what information do you have about smartphones what information do you have about smartphones what do you know about smartphones I'm waiting in the chat to see what you have to say about smartphones I know you're already using one and I know you're knowledgeable about smartphones but let's know what yes connects to the net I like that the average I I thinks that well he read somewhere that um the average smartphone is more powerful than the rocket ship sent out out of space I think that's a very good comment yeah they agile and can help to meet many services act as PR to yes pafic communication learning or smartphones yes smartphones have the internet access more or less my pocket office research communication I agree John I agree everything is possible these days smartphones is a great source of knowledge to me beautiful mini computer I like that it helps in communication Mary thank you um communication um using different app for different purposes thank you great comments and I'm happy that we know a thing or two about our smartphones next slide please the next slide please okay so the smartphone actually um this the slide before this one please the smartphone is actually a combination of two technologies one the cellular Mobile which connects you to the internet and then the handheld um computer like a laptop that you can use in you know on sitting down or SED in one spot so technology of these two um um devices is what has given birth to the smartphone and I'm sure many of you are aware um you have your Android and then you have your iPhones and these two these two U major platforms that you know give us this wonderful technology which is a smartphone is what many of us use today to solve many many problems and it can serve like many of you have said as a personal um computer you can use it anywhere you find yourself even though the screen is kind of limited but these days we have um audio um recording uh and uh you have voice recognition that can help you to even type or you know key in messages without NE using your your telephone to do all that so so what we have today is a very powerful device that we can use to solve many problems for some of us our devotionals are on our smartphones our calendars on our smartphones on lecture notes on our smartphones there's so much that we we can do uh with our smartphones and there are so many things that we cannot do these days without our smartphones so um many of us are so addicted to it that every moment you want to just pop just to check to be sure that something has not popped up popped up or your smartphone so um it's really a device that everybody is interested in the next slide please now here is some things you need to know about your smartphone um it's got the inut um aspect where things come into your phone we're going to be looking at that much later the touchscreen um physical buttons virtual keyboard the camera and the microphone is how information comes into your smartphone and then output when you want to um see the things that are in your smartphone um the screen display the LED indicator for the lights behind your phone the phone jackpots Bluetooth wireless and charging port these are all output segments of your smartphone the next slide please now here are some useful maintenance tips for your smartphone and I think everyone should take advantage of this information because it will help your smartphone to to perform optimally first is the the update S software you need to update your software as often as possible and you've got two major aspects of your software your on your smartphone you've got the the operating system software got to always update because sometimes um some of these security patches are attached to the phone um software and it helps to optimize productivity for your smartphone you also have to back back up your data as often as possible either on the cloud or on your um right you can lose um you can misplace your smartphone you can be stolen but if your data is backed up properly you would always have access to your your information then of course you've got to manage your storage how do you do that you delete unnecessary files um Sometimes some um some unwanted files are on your phone some unwanted apps on your mobile phone you have to find a way to uninstall some of those apps so that as all as as frequently as possible you you have enough space to do a lot of things so that your smartphone can operate smoothly now to optimize your battery live um you've got to to adjust your screen so that it doesn't it's not consuming your battery and then you can also use um the power saving mode to always close all the background apps that are running on your mobile phone so your battery life can also um last long and please whenever you charge your phones please do not do not use it while charging because if you do that it also um destroys your the battery live your phone do I need to tell you to protect your screen please protect your screen with um a a harder phone case so that you can prevent it from damage uh these days some smartphones the the cost of the screen is is as well the cost of the entire smartphone so you wouldn't want to um miss your spend so much because you are trying to uh maybe I don't know what you're trying to do not protecting the screens of the phones please always protect the screen of your phones with a screen guard or with a harder or study phone case then of course App Management um permission always make sure you know what app is permitting what what information to go out of your phone because some apps are designed to steal data so they have all these malware waiting just to get data from your phone so always check and be sure that the permissions are right for the apps that get information from your phone yes you can also secure your your phone with um passwords um and yes don't overcharge your batteries don't overcharge your batteries ensure that your batteries are are are charged appropriately some phones there's a specification for how long you can connect it to a battery charge uh charging device or electricity and so on and so forth these are some of the tips I think you should know about your smartphone and if you take these things very seriously it's going to help you to protect your smartphone and to have it always available for you to use can we go on to the next slide please now we're going to be talking about mobile apps what about mobile apps are we going to talking about well this I think um can we display the answer to this poll um or I think we've we've got we've done it already about mobile apps so let's go on to talk about mobile apps and um or should we display the answer to this poll again maybe that will help to put this conversation in proper context the second poll can we we display the results yes I can see the results as a teacher do you make use of mobile devices in your classroom and I can see what we have here the answer is um almost um um 79% say yes you use your mobile phone your device in a classroom wow so this is a good webinar for everyone who's here so you'll learn a thing or two about using devices in the classroom and the apps that you use and I'm sure you would want to share some of the information you've got about mobile apps in your classroom and then we've got another one are students allowed to use mobile phones in your school and classroom and the answer the what we have here is an overwhelming no 76% and that's something I think we should start thinking about um after today um all right we can stop sharing this slide now and move to the next point um the next slide please what are mobile apps well a mobile app is a software application designed to run a smart to to run on smartphones tablets or other mobile devices providing specific functionalities for users often through a userfriendly interface and that's what mobile apps are and we have a Galaxy millions of mobile apps you know being produced every every day and every minute of of the day and you can find these mobile apps on um Google Play store or app store if you're using an iPhone and these days um most companies have you know the the opportunity to sell um both the web app web enabled app applications and the ones that are not even web enabled some are designed to just get data from you and then they use it to U make you feel happy some of them have ai algorithms attached to them such that they control everything that you do or they want to be sure you know what you're doing part time so um we' we've got so many mobile phones available sorry mobile apps available for you to download and use on your phones now all you need to do is just think about a problem you think about a problem and you just go online and look for solutions that an app can provide for you and there are many um app de developers who are also looking for ideas so if you find an app developer most times they will ask you for ideas on what problems what challenges you are facing that a phone or a smartphone can solve they develop an app to solve that problem today we are going to be looking at mobile apps and um we have divided or categorized the mobile apps into three main segments the first one will be um the apps that you use before your lesson or your class when when are preparing for a lesson and then the second is the mobile apps you use while in class and then afterwards when you're done with your lecture for the day or your lesson for the day what are some of the mobile apps that you use all right so um the next slide please the next slide please okay here are some um interesting apps that you can use before your lesson Could you type in the chat um what other apps you use before your lesson while you're preparing for your lesson other than these ones that I have I highlighted here that I just on the screen um Could you type in the chat some mobile apps that you use while preparing for your lecture Pinterest yes thank you very much Pinterest is a very good mobile app bad yes an AI app that is really good it's good it helps Google Classroom whoa why you prepare for your class that's good AI YouTube yes um okay all right WPS YouTube yeah I can see another person has typed in YouTube I think I can tell why you use YouTube Google Scholar see AI app yes YouTube YouTube you see wow it's good all all right thank you so much for your inputs and um it's good to know that we are using mobile apps while we prepare for our lessons for the day and that's very important because these apps help us to have a solid um class um participation at least we are prepared for our lecture for the day if we you know use some of these apps in preparing now we're going to be looking at um some apps that are Google based Google Apps call them um apps produced by the Google um company and why not because um some of these apps are free in fact for Google if not all the apps you can use them for free and and they are really great applications and I'm hoping that by the end of this um webinar you'll find it very useful to maximize you know the free applications because some of these applications you've got to pay uh you've got to register some of them are highly restricted so for that purpose um it's better you start with the free ones and that that will help you to understand how um you know um you could use mobile apps to make life easier for you as an English language teacher so um some of the free Google apps that we have are the Google Lens Google Calendar Google Sheets Google Docs um Google forms Google Drive Google meet Google classroom and these are all free apps that uh we can use so um the next slide please and I would like you to say this um with all sense of sincerity how many of these um Google apps do you use are you familiar with or um and why why do you use these apps I like to see in the chat box what um you use these free mobile apps for and um why if you can um just pop in the chat just type in the chat what you think about um the free Google apps which ones are you familiar with which ones um do you use um on your screen you can see um the Google search engine you can see Gmail you can see Google Map YouTube um Drive YouTube music um we've got photo uh app then we've got files calendar and so on and so forth so I can see in the ch chat um I use Google Lens helps me scan Direction Maps yes um yes familiar with okay yeah familiar with meat and Maps good good YouTube Gmail calendar Gmail awesome so let's go to the next slide and I'll just say a little thing about the um Google Calendar on your screen for those who can see it um I know it's quite tiny but I'm sure afterwards would want to do another proper demo for those who would like to know how to use the Google Calendar now the Google Calender is one of those um apps that helps to organize your day your month your week your year before you enter before you even begin a semester is good you use a Google Calendar to plan the things that you want to do for the period now if you look at the arrows um pointing to your Google calendar these are all parts of your Google calendar if you see the icon it's it's that icon that looks there usually 31 written on it so you can't miss it um that's the the um the app the icon of the app and it helps you to organize your time and your day and it gives you so much opportunity to make live Easier for yourself because you can also um add new activities you can set a timer to remind you of when the activi is going to take place and if the activity will be repeated weekly you can see um just on your screen where it says do not repeat all you need to do is to click on it and it to tell you either to repeat or do not repeat so every every other week you have this activity and it keeps reminding you so if you have a class um it's good if you have a lecture it's good you you have all those things on your Google calendar to remind you of how to use um or maximize your time while in class um it's also a device that you can use to um keep record of other things other events um about your life professional development like we are having now the this webinar or you have a conference that will be in about a few weeks or a few months it has a way of making life easier for you um to manage your time wisely so if you have not used or if you have not been using your um Google's calendar this is a good time to activate it and begin to plan your events your activities for the day for the week for the month for the semester and it will help you to you know become more organized and it reminds you of everything that you need to do I mean being an English teacher is really tough because there's a lot you need to do you need to assess your students you need to you know you have your private life you've got professional development activities that you need to be part of so these are things that you should think of maximizing let's look at the next one which is the Google Lens um the next Slide the next slide is the Google lens is an image recognition technology now funny enough this particular utility Aid driven application is free and what you can use it to do is mindboggling it's mindblowing so while in class um before your lecture after your lecture this is one app that you should um begin to use if you don't have it on your mobile device you can just go to Google Play Store and download it I have just a few demonstration about how this app application works now if you have it on your device all you need to do is to use your the camera on your phone and point to an image to anything at all and select from the base um what you want it to do it can help you to translate from one language to another automatically in real time um it can also help you to get more information about anything you're looking for um and this is how it is really profitable for you when you are preparing for your class something you don't know about or you want to know more about all you need to do is just um use your the camera on your phone and point at it and it gives you instant information mind you this works with the internet so not got internet it might not work but it it helps a lot um in helping you to find vocabulary um for your students new words that you want them to talk about just by you you know pointing a camera at something it gives you detailed information it also helps in immersion if you want to immerse you want to want your students to be immersed in a particular language uh for those who would like to um teach in multilingual you know environment you find this app very useful can we go to the next slides um that that talks more about how to use Google lens and um the other things that you can you know benefit from it so this particular one is my favorite about Google Lens have you thought about um converting an image to text um we call it the um optical character recognition OCR where an image is transformed into a digital um editable format and this Google lens can help you do that so you you have you have something if you see in the demonstration you have something that is written you know is handwritten and you want to convert it into an editable text all you do is you point the camera to it activate the text um part of sorry you have left the slide can you come back to the slide just so that they can see the demonstration so all you do is you connect the device using your your camera you point at it and then it highlights all the the things that you need um you select everything you copy it and then you paste on an edit table um editable word processing app WPS can do that your Google doc can also also do that and you can edit that particular text to any any way you want it so if you're considering transforming um a hard copy um material into a digitalized format this is your excuse me this is your goto um app and it's free that's beautiful so um yes John Aila like that Google Google saving life since 190 that's funny thank you excuse me so let's go to the next slide that talks about um that talks about um translation sorry I need to take some water all right so while I Was preparing for this webinar I thought about it excuse me how do you translate a language you have not seen before and you this can help you while in class so you see a language maybe a student is trying to understand something he can't communicate in English but he can communicate in his local language his mother tongue and all you need to do is have him WR or you see that kind of text all you need to do is put your camera on that text in a language that you do not know and it changes the language into English language that you can read it's like a zoom lens that you place on something and it transforms it into what you want the device that you should have um it's an technology that you should have on your mobile on your mobile phones and use you can use it before your class during your class after your class and um you can translate anything in multi lingual setting so let's go to the next slide let's talk about some apps that you use while in class what are some of the apps you use VI in class well um uh thank you for your question a I I would respond to that perhaps maybe after after the webinar and maybe in our um group um social media platform will respond to that question that you have just popped in all right there's something about apps that you use um in classro the classroom for you as a teacher I'm sure some of these apps that you can see on your screen are things that you you're well aware of um the mentimeter for those of us who do a lot of um online Google Classroom teaching is good Google translator is also very good if you use it it helps you a lot and then the VLC player is that um um utility player that you can use to play downloaded videos or Audios in your class in case you want to teach um listening um compreh Pion you play it on your device salom gave us a fantastic webinar last a fortnite ago about using ICT devices and you can use your vcpr to play virtually any anything that you that is in multimedia form and then the stopwatch is that one that you can also use I mean in your class um to time activities you need to keep you need to keep um keep to time in everything that you do in your classroom so the stopwatch will really help you to manage time in your classroom what about dictionaries in an English language class your students should have the leverage of connecting to a maybe either an online dictionary or an offline dictionary whenever you're discussing a word or you want them to learn some things about lifelong learning and this is this also takes me to one very interesting thing that happens in my classroom um whenever I teach please go to the next slide um in my classroom many times I allow my students at specific times to connect to the connect to their mobile phones I know I mean because I have very large classrooms um so because of that sometimes it's even difficult to know who is using a smartphone or not in a class so since you can't really control them um all you can do is to make them use it constructively while in class so while they using it constructively you go around and be sure that they are you know connecting to their phones and they're using it to learn one of one or two things as a matter of fact there was a day I was in class and I told them to use open AI to look at some some things on their phones and some of them connected to WhatsApp and I was so mad why are you connecting to WhatsApp and they said well they have an AI on their WhatsApp that gives them information about you know anything they want to learn so it's amazing how you can use your smart your mobile apps in class you can encourage your students of of course you control and make sure that they don't abuse the opportunity but but always try as much as possible to give them um a good time um while they are in class teaching while they in class learning and you are also teaching and facilitating their learning process now the Google forms is one free app that you can use to access your students please next slide you can use this mobile you can use this to assess your students sorry the next one Google Translates we've talked about it let's talk about Google forms um so you can use it for assessment it's very easy all you need is to um type um forms. google.com and it automatically displays um this um what you can what please move to the next slide move to the next slide let's talk about Google forms quickly before our time goes off the next slide please good thank you so for assessment you can use Google forms to assess your students you can type in a short quiz or a test um I I love to do formative assessment so every time I connect to um to my students when I engage them
I always want to have a feedback if they are following what we are doing in class and the easiest way to do that is to give them a test and the test helps me to know if I need to reinforce specific areas of their learning so to create a a Google form all you need to do is go to forms. google.com um there are many templates that you can click on um here we have assessment um you go to new you create the folder you create the form and you can go ahead to help your students to um learn and to know more about you know what you have taught them by just assessing them and knowing if they are following um I'll give you a proper demo maybe a short video um when we connect in the telegram group I'm sure Gary will will share the link now um for those who would want to maximize Google forms for assessing their students and to be sure that your students are following especially if you like me who likes to do um fortive assessment so after every class I have something to um connect with my students to be sure that they are following what um we are doing in class so you could have access to these slides so that you can follow step by step alternatively please use the link that Gary has just posted to connect the telegram group and on Friday we're going to be discussing um some of these applications in case you need Clinic you just want to be sure that you're doing the right thing we'll show you how to use some of these applications to make your classroom um engagement effective and efficient the last um aspect of our conversation today is the post um lesson applications you can move to the next slide um that talks about post lesson applications um I'm sure some of you would like to relax afterwards um so after after your lecture after your class for the day you want to relax sometimes all you need is social media I can see so many social media applications please move to the next slide on that talks about some post Lessing apps very good thank you very much yes so post Lessing applications you can always um connect with your students on social media you can also connect with your friends and colleagues on social media and it helps you to relax and connect with other people around the world du lingo is also another very important application that you can use to learn language you know in a structured Manner and that can also help you in teaching English language in a structured manner um the next up the next um slide please next slide please yes the next slide is on Google Drive sometimes you need to store your um materials documents on Google Drive and these these um will help you to keep tabs on all the things that you have your information your data it keeps everything for you in a cloud how to how how to get access to your Google drive there are some nine dots um beside your login profile on on Google click on it it will open um this what you can see here as a drop down menu and gives you access to your drive and you can create a new drive that will help you to store information and you have up to 15 gab of free space to store anything videos pictures documents and so on and so forth so maximize the Google drive to store information that you can retrieve anywhere in the world um all you need is just a login um detail and for you to log to um Google to have a Google account is free so um I would enjoin you to have a a Gmail account so that you can maximize um your Google Drive for um getting your information afterwards the next slide please games of mobile apps for El it's accessible to all Learners anybody who wants to learn um you can have access to um applications that will help you to make life easier for you to make your interaction with your students better and then of course it's interactive and engaging um there are so many applications that we didn't even talk about today the board for example Zoom um we using Zoom now for interaction it's Ruble app you can use it and then we have also cost effective and um scalable um gains it's cost effective to use your app to solve many problems imagine what you would have done typing for for a long time and all you need to do is just scan and it becomes digital and then of course you can personalize your Lear learning can make learning even The Learning Experience more personal and it helps everybody both students and teachers to sit on the front seat when it comes to interaction they can interact face to face um I'll be glad to take your questions now even though we're really running short of time but like I said earlier and I think um um Gary has posted in the chat box um that you can join um you can join in our telegram group um we can where we have these conversations every week um so I'll be glad to to take your questions now or we can answer some of those questions in the chat in in the telegram telegram group I know that we've got um challenges many of us in our schools students are not allowed to use smartphones and that's quite a challenge but we can surmount it um if policy makers understand how how important how people can learn to use these things um I'm sure they can stem the tide and then we also have to teach our students to be honest and teach them virtue on how to go about these things um yes way you can project your phones yes please yeah just there there's an interesting question there I mean we don't really have time to do much but but as AEL is saying you join us next week or you can join us now on on the telegram group so I put links in into the chat but there is a question there from FIA about great you're telling us the different opportunities technology is brought into elt my concern is how do you translate all the facts you've told us in African classrooms with all the contextual constraints we're having so it's the same it's a kind of common question but maybe we can you know we can look at that salomi if if you haven't seen it uh salam's presentation last week was was a very good example of of how you begin to rethink technology in in a low resource context so have a look at that and then come along on Friday or start asking questions immediately on on the telegram group and we can start sort of looking at that issue because it's a very important issue but it's an issue that I think people like Abel and salame and other colleagues another a number of other colleagues are also addressing that kind of issue around the subaran African uh you know context so we can have a great debate about it so there are 14 new messages mostly saying how good presentation is which I agree with it was a very good presentation oh thank you I'm I'm flattered thank you so much
so as you can see now we are you have learned markdown so far you've seen what markdown is capable for creating static content and now we're adding those Leah script features and that are just uh like with the tables this might be just a simple reinterpretation or we add some slightly some slight additional uh markdown syntax or syntactic sugar to it to add some features that are not were not previously there in markdown so the focus now is just like including multimedia including any type of different types of quizzes and probably service and adding also this uh yeah animation presentation stuff spoken out languages or spoken out text and this so and the first thing that we'll do if you go to probably a script to the next slide there is this multimedia and if you think of the ideas just like we had those link notation with reference to an external website then this image is just an important link probably which is marked by an exclamation mark in our case the first thing that we probably wanted to embed in this sound just like uh some music from other websites or an MP3 file or something like this so instead of or using the markdown syntax so next to an exclamation mark we use the question mark which might you might think of it probably it looks like an ear so it resembles if the exclamation mark is an image the question mark is probably you could use it for sound so you have those two links in between so the first one is just a link to an MP3 and if I so it will refer me to this link and I'll just tell you a script this is a sound file from embedded so that it can be replayed so just add a question mark in front of it and then it's embedded probably it could be anything but you can also go and I added those service like multimedia from SoundCloud an external provider for music if you go to SoundCloud Pro you can search for what might be interesting I don't know we'll choose this one and this is also we have this website and wants to embed this so we simply refer to this link copy this go back to the Leah script editor I add this link in here so just referring to the same site so if you're on markdown it will point you or bring you to the same site but actually if you want to embed this with a question mark take some times and you have now this music service or whatever embed it so you want to so in the next evaluation so if so the idea was if question mark is some kind of like of sound and exclamation mark is an image then probably exclamation marking question mark the same pattern still a URL but now we're using uh image and sound together so and you can try it by your own just copy in YouTube link at this as a markdown link and add these two exclamation marking question mark in front of it so I can also do it just like going to YouTube it could be also a another streaming service or might be interesting I don't know some video of Mozart you know of course it's implementing some German facts about Mozart simply copy this website URL go back to the or just like Leah movie to get this if you need this additional help just type Leah movie enter we again add the URL and the website and the video is imported or embedded directly so you can play it from there and there's a next iteration step if you actually cannot distinguish it is it a video is it music is something totally different you can always try to embed or use the so the next iteration step the question question mark syntax in this case uh if we have this from sketchfep if you go to the volume of sketchfap is just like a service for 3D models and you can search for any kind of what might be interesting years yeah that's a lot of stuffing going on if you want autonomy so this thing actually loads the overlap something like a 3D model of the stuff and we want to refer to this specific 3D model or something else so then we just tell layerscript by it's not use this here question question mark to embed this 3D model actually so if the service allows it so the script will detect the method detect the method to how to import the content properly and if not like in this case there's this nice simulator I just did it like this so there's a circuit simulator that you can use it's a it's a Java applet I guess and you have different probably as someone switched to German so this is this kind of little nice animation so that you can also export this probably as a link so which is basically doing only running the simulation and if you want to embed this kind of simulation or something else into your script document you simply add this link altitude and add the question question mark so I don't care how just try to embed it if this or embed service doesn't work try to embed this as an iframe so in most cases the iframe will work too and then there is the simulation so you can play around with it I don't know another one switch to another one to some measurements or uh yeah okay so this is the idea just if there is something within the internet you can embed it this way just like in Leah script or refer to an external resources that's not an image or not a link so is if you don't use a title because it's in some cases it might won't work probably because the content creator or those have changed their server settings or for whatever so it will display this actually as a subtitle but if you don't like this so you that you if even if the simulation or whatever does not work does not load you can refer or jump to the next slide and if you want to this is like a default fallback you can also use the title syntax sir create simulation of some thing and then you get this as your subtitle caption how do you copy the link I just copy this link so this is just and the website actually tells me uh tells the script how to embed the concepts so the content is this 3D model and it's stored within the ad so it's summer for you it depends so you have you can download those I think it's mostly for downloading but you can also search for cc by license or something like this yeah because I also do CC zero or something like this you can search by licenses some are paid some are not and so but you are not downloading it you're just referring to this I I don't know how the actual situation is if you just display it probably but it's always the best to use this one of the CC uh licenses in this case you can also download it directly and reuse it in your whatever it is so the next thing so this is quite easy actually if we go to the next one we have a couple of images right paintings by Leonardo da Vinci so and they are just like single blocks you know just like the image is displayed it's not full width because it would not fit into the Container but if I want to do something like a gallery like in our case a gallery is nothing like a if you think about it it's just a paragraph which contains only multi media links or content so if you just remove between your multimedia content the spaces make it just like one text paragraph So the same idea same logic so recompile this I get this nice little Gallery there are subtitles that are like this so it can increase go on and you can try this out by your own if you want to multimedia means you can use also these other type of links that display some sound or YouTube or something like this just like it added us to the front oops so same idea we have just now we have two embeds and then there's a couple of images if we recompile this it takes some time and we have the same stuff in here you can increase this go through this load this model if we want to or a couple of similar models to the simulation and also visit the images and stuff like this so the idea is pretty simple a paragraph full of multimedia objects becomes a gallery so that's it so to which made sense actually from our perspective sorry for instance we we ate one picture Within the Big Image resolution back then when we demonstrating on that size also made in terms of the the layout uh yes although if you this is actually much bigger that it is displayed in here and so if it's bigger it's yeah displayed in full but you can have it with a mouse or a touch actually and you can increase this so this is just a basic idea if you use this plain the script approach but you can also reconfigure it with your if you know some bit of CSS HTML something like this by your own but just like we can if you're interested in we can do it I can charity later to you so yeah you actually don't have to care about so the script will try to presented it for you in the appropriate way so far so good so quizzes so it's proven the students perform better probably can script might tell this test it has proven that students perform better when they have the possibility to reflect quizzes are an ideal way to check the understanding Leah script currently has support for different types of quizzes with the possibility to tweak them right and the only thing to your that you have to remember when working with quizzes is that there are some surrounded with these brackets mostly double brackets or within containing parentheses there's just like a similar pattern that we will try to repeat or find useful for using with all types of quizzes uh right so the first one is just a simple text input so the pattern for quizzes looks if I remove those back ticks so it will provide me you have to question probably it can just change the content to whatever to video script so this is the solution what markdown I love you so the question actually ends probably is check it right damned it's another one gate hub check now okay what is the solution the solution is actually Leah script so you get a quiz simply so this is just a pattern for the double brackets text input so this could be a number this could be a text something else so yes but you can adapt this there's just uh there are also additional uh tweaks and you can also I'll show it to you later so because actually you need to do this because we had the time if you're doing math quizzes probably someone types in a number with a comma or dots another range specific value or the other one uses um minus 0.2 the other one one point or minus VR plus so numbers might be they have different inputs but you can dynamically also interpret them so that if they want ads Pi or e or 3.15415 something that you get a correct result so this is possible so the another one is just a simple selection so in the selection case you are provided with options and options just like some input this can be marked down again so I could highlight this with bold and this is actually highlighted and the only thing is that the these are separated by this um vertical lines and then the option the correct option is actually marked with this parenthesis if I recompile this you get the selection so you see you have to choose one this is the correct answer I check this okay congrats you got the right here the quiz is solved or whatever it could be also a formula that you input into it or an image or a video or something like this so it would be the correct Choice and then now the next step because we can markdown is just like defining one pattern reusing it in a couple of ways so one way you can do is probably Define something like a gap text it uses the same pattern about that this is a selection actually but can you I don't know can train languages or something like this so if you fill in that for example wasn't okay I have no idea I don't want to type in I'm curious just what is the correct solution and we'll put it into you for you in this case the size how many space you leave it's just like in hint to your users how much amount or how big the word might be and combining and you will learn this later so to tweak this quiz for example so animations are always as you've seen with double braces as I mentioned so this is just like a simple pattern for just add a play button to it so that you can play out the sound so I have now this Gap text quiz I add a play button onto on top of it and so I can just like those I can do funky funky funky I just the film that I saw those night wasn't very good it was all funky a man funky built a time machine so he funky travel back probably that doesn't sound good so something in case you can try experiments so probably what sounds better actually and if you ever saw the quiz now so okay this is the right how does it the film that I saw that night wasn't very good it was all about a man who built the time machine so he could travel back in time it's so just the idea just another pattern added to a quiz probably quiz is just you have to remember those uh double brackets in this case and you can reuse this make a table a quiz you can make a quotation uh block quote a quiz you can probably not code in this case but anything else can be a quiz in this case so that you can use for your purposes just as a text input so and if we stay with a this notation so from our point of view so this was an easy way just like it looks like radio buttons for us so you just like we use this brackets again but then parentheses within so roundish View and if I check this so you get this radio button such a single Choice quiz actually right so I can check this I can add as much options as I want to so what is now the correct solution I guess I can only choose one this one is wrong this one as well yeah in this case you are responsible for your quizzes if there is an X both options are actually correct so this wasn't right a correct option and the other one clicked would be probably also right so if you want to be more kind to your students and if we use this metaphor again and go to the multiple choice quizzes multiple choice quiz are mostly check boxes right so and how do they look from our perspective just like one but this is not a text because you cannot add an x x is a pointer for a check box in this case or the marking of a checkbox so it's not a text quiz so if we go to this so we have now multiple Solutions where we can the last one so this is pointing not to right direction so the quiz should look like this so so I hope the idea is clear actually from our point of view there is no easier way for creating quizzes like this and you can do this even go to your next level do it more extreme so this is quite easy but you can combine those radio buttons and check boxes and something like an uh the metrics so then the entire block here you have a single Choice quiz and you have your multiple choice quiz so it's just like a combination of both the one is a vector the other one is a matrix um so this is obviously the correct solution or whatever you can we you know there was a good example for German like articles in this case so you can have multiple articles for words that even pepperoni or paper cup which even for some cases German used different articles for the same word but yeah it's probably another good example yeah the recording of the results just recorded you know for the students by himself but is there a possibility for the teacher to do a recording of how people answered and then also to do an analysis over time or to correlate the data that they answered maybe with another course you can if you it's not by default so but you can if you want to export this probably to a school package upload this within your Moodle and you will see the progress of your students when they did which quiz Pro probably and how they performed but in this case you're always free to add any kind of can show to you a little bit too much I guess so you can embed like Scripts where you can Define and this is just a let's make an alert so if I do now check probably I get the result this is actually how it's stored and this could be also sentenced to somewhere else to this case to inform this with an ID of the course of the student or something like this or how he performed it so this would be a way to manage or to yeah to to run such a lecture in such a professionally in lectures then I'm doing this in classroom and as we saw in the previous session you get a summary of the different results but of course these have to be stored and I use mostly snapshot of the diagram to have yeah and this and this is also like the way if you know a little bit of JavaScript how if you treat different inputs and how you can check them I do make everything lowercase uppercase remove the white spaces and compare it afterwards probably to my uh input or to the correct solution and one thing that's actually great about this possibility there is you can react to a different patterns so if your student makes similar mistakes or different ones that you can actually handle it because one of the learning paths didn't fit and you get stuck to somewhere you can see this probably or detect these patterns within the solution within the text inputs if they do the addition correct and you can react and then afterwards also as you say move them to another location so you have to repeat this part of the quiz probably again because it didn't work for you or you can count the misses or the not correct answers in this case so this is just like scripting I already showed to you but I won't go into soon more into details the last thing is if you want to go give some hints to your students then you're also stuck with the two brackets notation but you add a question mark to the to it so this is the script probably I'll check this out I already did this sorry I have no idea because I want to give a want to see the hint and now you have just like a list so the first you have to write the correct answer the solution with starts with Leah something like this you can add this much support as you want to and this can be added to any type of quiz if it's um um Simple Text input as you can see now it's a multi uh Choice quiz if it's a single Choice quiz or it's a gap text or something like this is always just adding this pattern a list of question marks within brackets to your quiz and you get those possibility to add hints actually to the quiz and the next one if you want to provide a solution or an explanation to this so we simply add a block and this is just like marked with those stars or surrounded by Stars by a horizontal line so you can get those quiz there are no hits anymore so I don't know check so I'll resolved this and it will present me with a explanation some link it could be a video a multimedia content or like in this case also what was possible in the script to add some ASCII art images that are directly rendered so okay so far so good um yeah or if you click onto the resolve button so it's in both cases so it's just like the explanation so it's possible to disable this yes it's within the documentation it's just like you add this additional comment in two of it and then you can disable hints or you can say that the hints button or the result button is shown only after a couple of uh false trials or something like this so you can also tweak these elements so this is just like just as we've seen it today but what didn't work in my case is just like with service I like the little brothers of quizzes where don't provide any solution but you provide options actually but the writing is still the same in this case this would be just if we want to do a survey with a one-liner you just add like three lines three underscores and if you can see it in this case you want to have multiple lines it could be three of what it means this is a line input and this is a more complicated text input if you do your survey afterwards this will be rendered as a word cloud this is a collection of quizzes and in the same case you don't provide a solution to your single choice survey but you give them names options so okay thanks nothing happens but we can make it visible because we're not in the classroom script I made it again so what's how does the input look like so you get this dictionary of excellent is not rated code is not rated okay is rated poor is rated and this could be sent to another back end this is stored within your learning management system uh stuff like this so that's the basic idea and the same interesting because I guess no I think we need a license yeah and this was the single Choice and then the multiple choice actually basically the same so you don't have to remember the pattern actually it's just like I hope it's obvious it's not that difficult at all and now probably this last part will be my uh would be might interesting for you is just like to add these animation steps uh to speak out content loud so in this case because it's not used in the markdown syntax we use these just like braces and this if you want to add braces you added just with numbers within the animations which point to the animation step and they are just like two options but you can have a more of course but you simply adds to your block to your markdown block and this case probably when it should appear so that it looks a bit more beautiful this should be the first one this should appear as a second one and as it's pointed out it disappear at animation step three so this is uh live from two to three animation step and okay of course I added in there this is three and the entire table probably is four so in the text book format everything is visible you just get those hints where or which blocks might be interested because you are mentioning them in your presentation or the first part of the second part and if you switch the presentation mode started like this so these are not visible but they should appear within the next step so everything that's not marked will be directly visible like forever if you want to close it you start with zero up till the third animation step or something like this so then it appears where it's part within your text so you can rearrange it and it will appear there so this must be the first part of the blog so this was the second part but it should appear disappear as an animation step three so it disappeared of course the number is not correct and last but not least the table so this is actually it's just a simple add-on to the basic markdown annotation where you can Mark blocks to certain animation steps and if you get one step further there's also annotation for inline so where you exclude those double braces like this so we now have five animation steps table the part is missing and there's this at step two oh that's wrong but this again if you're doing your tables which might be visualized directly because it presents some data you could also combine these animation steps with which would change afterwards the visualization of your data does that make sense to you so you start with the first value afterwards you change the value in a second one or something like this and it's your if you run a visualization step this will also change the type of visualization all the animation sorry I'm also thinking of mathematical calculations displaying steps of so that's it so far it's also okay it can go on last but not least text to speech so we have a different default voice that we are using at the moment with the next part of the section we'll show you how you can change the default also voice but yeah the basic notation for comments that should be spoken out loud as you've seen it before it's just like those braces with a number surrounded by those two dashes so if Ubuntu speak the content out loud probably this one is the first one and this one is a German one so it will sound like an English person pronouncing or trying to speak German but you can change the default voice sorry these are just like minus minus those one ah can you see his face is ah no it's just uh it's it's a visualization it's not editing too it's just a simply space and this is what the editor shows you just to to give some hints for the indentation so this one this one should appear as a second one and now you could use probably just if you don't want this is in the documentation in the script so there are all the voices presented but you can do something voice German female somehow called like I don't know why German female is the only one that's Deutsche female mentioned so in just case you can override the default uh voice within another voice and the order doesn't care it could be also there's an interesting it could be like in this case so and if we enable the sound there is nothing um too far too I just load might be I thought [Music] what am I doing wrong is amazing the problem though there is something with the parenthesis is there a minus too much okay there might be some kind of space in between I don't know no again okay it's not showing up so now we can just animation step zero nothing happens and then the entire markdown paragraph right below the effect definition in double minus notation is sent to responsive voice to speak the text out loud if you click on the ear button at the navigation panel then this paragraph gets rendered at the place where it is defined blue text and copy and paste it so it's now rendered directly within the browser and if the browser doesn't have support for text to speech output it will use responsive voice but it's just like you can switch between those prefer browser TTS or switch to responsive voice just like an open service you can use it and the German voice foreign these steps this type of documentation with your animation steps to get some narrative presentations so everyone can click to uh through this course or the content by its own gets the sound feedback or spoken out loud and also the visual animation steps like in any ordinary screencast probably made on YouTube where someone is clicking through the slides and talking something about this content or something like this so just the basic idea you can now combine this with tables images animations coding if you want to quizzes and create your own public and free or with your own license courses yeah so this would be the script part so far if you have some questions ah sorry which one you this one is not showing up ah this one if you yep it will because we don't have the license for the live editor within the sorry uh within the uh Leah script course website then it will be because we have a license key for this website and it will use responsive voice if your browser doesn't have a responsive voice probably Firefox not by default but if you switch to chrome chrome has this uh embedded so you might check this if you open the same or not this course or copy this content into the Chrome browser so we're also using the Chrome browser in this case so then you will have by default the text to speech engine or output well it depends but the nice thing is that most Android systems nowadays have a quite good text-to-speech engine and also these feature phones they have a really good text-to-speech engine that works offline so but in case it didn't work you can always switch back to yeah the text input another kind of visualization thank you so some other questions but I can probably if I export this course to gist as a GitHub guest probably I can send you the link and you can try out the text-to-speech engine so what I'm now doing is just I'm not using the browser there's a little opportunity on GitHub copy paste the link I have to enter again yeah or just copy and paste the content it's still within the other browser foreign which Chrome do you have or chromium or Chrome it should actually copy but you can um the entire markdown paragraph right below so uh what I did is just I exported this piece of content to the uh as a data URI I can add this to the um it's showing up but what you can do I copy the link if you want to test it within your browser you can copy this link below here oh yeah um the entire markdown paragraph right below the effect definition the double lines notation is sent to responsive voice to speak to text out loud [Music] one time available section one means I have to one Implement one Mouse kick oh one two three it's a similar pattern as for all other animations okay but you can add here if it's necessary The Voice so did it work for you all so also new of course but yeah [Music] um probably we have to Adaptive it's in English or U.S English really French and then just copy those things Listen to I think for English you need to like this UK and us and follow it I don't know why they made this distinction that's probably more but now it's just like it's locked if you go back and forth it will be faster yeah it might be the if your browser doesn't understand that there's no switch between us and UK and you can model this type the entire Market it's the same it will default to um prevent education from going to be the next uh to the next Slide the next model before completing the assignments for completing and or maybe even listening to no that's uh it is possible to add this functionality but it's a hacky way it's not uh possible by default because the idea was just to have anybody anyone to access all the content whenever he wants to not to make an additional barrier so do you have a login or something like this or that you have to solve those quizzes before you can just inspect it play around with it and this is it it's so this that you can only go to the next section next section is not possible by default so it would be possible document to the solution of a certain quiz results but in this way it's not very comfortable you have different uh different documents thank you so there will always be a solution or something like this so it's possible to implement but yeah not by default so now it's a question you switch to a very short introduction to now we'll get more professional [Music] okay um okay short Summit a short summary of all the points we mentioned before we wrote a document that contains interactive elements of Electro and now we can start to rearrange recombine review course this means we have different versions version one was a course about German literature someone was able to identify the error he corrects it later and the second author translated the course material to a new language or used a completely different context yeah we have a text document that can be applied to specific deductible goals of your individual um lecture content and this means we need some kind of version management we need a an approach to control the development of the material for this purpose and this meets and you see this according to the different authors leads directly to the idea of open educational resources many authors work on the same context they provide some plugins they provide content and others recombine the results reuse the results and that this very old idea was already mentioned by UNESCO and but until now um it it does not arise very small community that focus on the questions on the requirements mentioned by UNESCO we would like to store and copy the content we use reuse the material we avoid many efforts to reinvent the wheel it should be possible and this is an important aspect from my point of view to process the materials a PDF document that cannot be changed according to my specific need makes it difficult to reuse the application and you remember we have a pure text document it's very iron for a very easy to recombine the elements adaptive adapting missing or at the last point we will talk about dissemination of course I have to contact I have to distribute my materials and it should be easily exportable to different Learning Management Systems in a way that the students can use the context in the familiar way just to remember what what's happened we want to coordinate different versions and probably you remember your master C's especially something like this how did you organize different versions how in most cases or for many students um such a folder structure like this um appears or if some had a plan in her mind they used some dates to identify the most actual the most current version but of course it's not fine you have different redundant information in parallel when was the last the file XY deleted what was the adaptation How can I revise a certain manipulation in a file all these questions have to be done manually in this situation I would like to take A View to an alternative approach Wikipedia used version management that allows to monitor the development of the of an article if you take a view to the okay you take A View to arbitrary article you can view the complete history and at the ends we wish such americanism for our learning platform and in this way you are able to identify what was changed who was responsible should we probably have a discussion in a review process about it and can I go back to a certain oh Leonardo DiCaprio Leonardo da Vinci
she seems to generate a huge amount of versions during 2023 and we can adapt reconfigure evaluate them but to go back to uh what was the starting point okay  but of course Wikipedia has a complete different idea we have one Central document and in most cases we are just interested in the newest of them and using an responsible way this means we have one instance of the article but in our case Learning Materials we have different versions in parallel the solution for the experts from Wikipedia was an integrated editor this was a great invention for involving as many authors or potential authors as possible we have a defined setup and defined description language that allows static website static this is important aesthetic website is not appropriate for transporting learning content in a motivating way quality checks and visibility of course it's it's given here what is the fashion load approach what is the approach coming from software development version management is of course a Hot Topic if you are a member of the or contributor for the Linux kernel a huge amount of programmers working together to reach a common goal so they have to coordinate their work and they have to find methods for understanding who was responsible for changes it should be possible to identify accidental changes and to undo them in a history of the code ignoring some changes appearing in the meantime it's necessary to coordinate these activities to declare responsibilities for different tasks and so on and this can be done with the version management system the currently dominating one is git existing other ones but git is a distributed setup that is used for especially for Learners kernel and many other projects since 2005. kit allows you to have a separate representation of the project on your computer and it synchronizes your changes with all other members of your team we will give you a short introduction about your implementation soon after what does it mean if version a version of a new file so you've made some changes and afterwards you recognize that they are worth to be referenced in the version management history of your course I Illustrated this by the state machine you have a generation of a file currently it's not um considered by the version management system it's untracked and we added so specific file or folder or a huge amount of files on a stage level so we um playing git that these files folder is relevant for our repository this means we have a Leah script document probably some images we made some changes and now we staged those folder file structure in git and then we have the next point after stating them they will be accepted or committed to the version management system so we have two steps for the process of one new version and then this process is implemented in a loop again this means we have a two steps first the staging level on a local implementation and afterwards a Commit This means our local repository now knows about the changes that appeared in my system and afterwards I run further adaptations again the pattern is the same and in the second stage I have to organize a synchronization everyone should know that I changed my my version of a course for instance and with bit push I'm able to um send the new version to a repository and this information can we get with GitHub clone or git pull from the central device Central is not correct in this case it's a distributed system but you know there is a specific instance of the repository that manages the distribution of new versions this was a short git as a command line tool for synchronizing versions a very limited view of course we have no time to address all aspects of this tool hence we want to lift on the next level GitHub it contains git in his name GitHub is a web service addressing the capabilities of git and cover them by several services for managing for controlling larger software projects and this is a perfect platform for coordinating our course development if we are not as in the moment working alone but with the number of contributors with a number of colleagues in the same context I would like to show you in example so pure project or your organization with your courses and then they are on GitHub they are directly accessible to other users okay what does it mean as Andrew explained we use GitHub to store all the content of our Leah script courses used in this tutorial you realize they are MD markdown files in this folder structure and there are some images just one that was included in the presentation and a readme file and so on and if you take a view a closer view to the content you know all these aspects GitHub renders the existing markdown code but if we take a view to the actual raw file you'll realize that this is a basic template for Leah script course and in my um scenarios I mostly add such a button here which is nothing else then in simple reference on the actual address of the lia script online course but it's helpful to really fast start the course material we have now our material India in GitHub and you see that I make a last change five hours a day again before and we have 13 commits 13 new versions from our material and you see that we Andrew started 19 hours ago to implement the course material afterwards I added some adaptations included some extensions from the GitHub perspective and to ensure that the content we currently speaking about is reference the corrective way the idea we have a complete overview about all activities and this means I can go back and understand which changes were made during the last version Oh a new picture comes into this game and I apply adapted the corresponding reference on this image you are an expert now in Leah script and you know that this notation means we include a figure a figure not from the internet but from a local folder which can be stored in the GitHub structure too yeah see yep so what you basically think about doing is to use GitHub as the old mitigation resources if possible so not to use like for example if you can Media or other external sites but to create complete folders including all the resources so yes probably we can switch very fast um to another course to another foreign collected all the courses don't mention that these are written in German are all courses from our working group for instance software development it's a course containing all lectures materials and we are able to control the progress and if we take a view to the number of comets he'll realize hey it's an ongoing process of permanent improvements of implementing the requested features from students adaptations the content as well of the um execution environment in this way and we have different releases for the last three years we can take a view to the state that was a region this year so each change or all changes can be understand and analyzed in this way what I already mentioned is that our students are working in this project commonly with us 17 contributors means that they made adaptations According to some errors typos and so on yeah and yes GitHub is used here for storing for organizing the work in some repositories we used issues and then those additional features features for controlling the working process who's responsible to adapt lecturer l16 related to blah blah blah these are opportunities given in GitHub too so can you also know assignments in this app yeah you can add if he if we add some new issues you can of course hear it responsible persons you can add deadlines who should apply a certain new aspect it's possible to have a very not complex but but a very detailed Maya Stone planning kanban boards what is to do if what have to be done in the next week all these aspects are covered by the web-based platform around the git um to edit their module and put them oh yeah yeah or they and this is not happen will happen with your material or they used the individual representations by Forks so I have an implementation for our Dakar tutorial and you and this is the next step you will Fork it to make a copy of the current version and of course we are able to synchronize them again but in this situation you have your own copy and can work independently for instance you're on software developer and you have completely different focus in your course so you extract only some parts and extend the course with your specific learning material and this means we have now in parallel different course courses it's the same name probably but with different activities interesting and of course if you are looking for clear script just for the name in different repositories you can find of course our courses but there are some fancy guys this is from Munich okay um talking about theoretical computer science embed systems and all these things and of course next step is to look for an um appropriate license are these materials allowed to be embedded in other contexts can I use the information on others okay but is this is one way to disseminate um geoscript courses now you it's your time again please go to GitHub and generate an account if it exists and then would be great if you go to our website and this is already visible on our on our is a pet the bitly course and then you can Fork you can click on the fork button to generate your individual s repository like in my cases and then it's like github.com so choose your name you can use an arbitrary name it's not important at this position afterwards you can also create like organizations if you want to but it's where multiple authors Incorporated different repositories  and positive and I use this to store your company some of the students start in our courses with fictional names and later they replaced the starting Name by their yeah the end user repositories have worked for as an application in an application please take A View to my contributions to blah blah to ensure reviewers or interested employees employers to hire them this will be foreign  the problem there's this lives in like a 10 000 years project so they like Microsoft is building data centers around the world so they actually want to preserve not only the human knowledge but they also associate that code open source and whatever has been written there there's also some kind of a human needs that they need to be stored so let's later historians might research our codes or some of this or we need some other stuff where they need our codes that we've written to so if you are publishing GitHub can I be a chance that your code will be stored for 10 000 years for the future the recognize a group that meets in Dakar in 2000 yeah script or the oer community like throughout the year like four times or so you know and it's trade like cohorts of teachers using that because I mean it wouldn't make much more sense if everyone uses GitHub you know and knows how to do it yeah it's it's hard it's why we implemented this uh live editor and there's also it GitHub and editor embedded but it's like um we always have to problem German teachers they they don't want to learn new things and if it looks like coding which which is actually isn't yeah so but that's another thing I was thinking I mean if you have what you think what do you get at its own yeah and you have the same basic environment I mean obviously creating course is super simple you know it's only the the coding that maybe turns people off yeah but later on when they see that they can switch between the textbook and the presentation mode and better than a learning management system only really works with us in Chrome external you know they cannot really combine synchronous formulas in some of foreign I mean before we had this database like not all and some organizations super difficult to use only certain Snippets uh editors also you know so cool edits I think that's that's a super powerful idea so what I for example would do no because we're also thinking about organizing a course on you know digital credentials and open Badges and so on and we have different models and every model is chaired by one person so to give them like an assignment but everyone has to go through the course on U.S trips obviously and so on and the question is so what I realized was the master classes that I did before you could now do the recording and they could go through the recording or you do something Independent Learning performance so you'll offer all the theory before then they come in asynchronous session like now okay and you do the exercises and then you make sure that they really know it you give them a certificate and it's a certificate is a prerequisite of being invited into the GitHub repository you know what I mean the order has been clear for me I have to prepare people prepared it's like an exam and then I received the they got a certificate yeah the thing is that if you would start assigning now tasks in GitHub it's too complicated okay because people need to untangle everything what we have done today  is missing the task means at this position task force contributor in the course material exactly that we say this is the model that you are responsible for you know what I mean yeah so and then you assign them this model but you can only assign it to them when you know that they know what to do you know what I mean that they can actually edit they understand we are being assigned the task there is no chance for for me something of that sort so they want to maybe give access to people who now already know so maybe but for training purposes you you have to to work with anything so perhaps maybe if it's under an organization I don't know how you manage the gift Closer by the external organization you can say maybe you can use the organizations could details only if in your personal capacity you have demonstrated that you know all the community created and if you talk about an open source project then someone comes up with a really cool idea and he is his writes an issue and that hey I have a new feature what what do you think about and then some people discuss about and at the end he implements this stuff and sends the full request that we will do this later from his fork in this extended implementation he sent a copy to the original project and said hey Tina yeah I guess you will uh keen on if people know exactly what to do then that's a perfect way if they are already like part of the community and then you know stumble upon it and say that's great but um your use case is I have to admit relatively narrow because it's I.T related or for example if you have to use case that's more pedagogical oriented and you need to have someone who has started pedagogy or something like that to move into that environment um it's obviously like kind of shifts and that's what you've sent it for you know like the German teachers would not like to uh the problem of teachers they don't want to live they want to teach yeah yeah but I guess before we reach teachers on this multi-author collaborative level um we have to force them to use the online editor before it's a large stage for them to understand hey everyone can use it's not my materials anymore it's yeah but so let's just assume you would do a course on oer production and so that's a joint course from the open University in Zimbabwe and the bag Academy in Ryback that you can even get ECGs credits towards the certain studies because it's teaching some of the content that you anyways need to learn so and you are you know broadcasting this again whoever finishes that has two ways you know you can qualify with that certificate to be your internal maybe Champion you know so with the idea that every educational organization has an oer representative who knows about that technique you know what I mean and and you could maybe learn to the level the the quality expectations of the same in terms of what needs someone to do in order or needs to know or needs to be able to do in order to uh you know like be that ambassador of oer um practice means we have to come from the consequences we have to offer as many tutorials like this video lectures about the usage of the S3 behavior only twice per year twice per year we do a one-week course something like that online or even like two weeks with one session per week you have pre-read material in the beginning you are you have to go through your own result in order to you know qualify for the first session you are doing the exercise agreements you know and break on sessions Etc and then you have the second session where you're talking about the guitar okay we can probably discuss this yeah yeah anyway so it is a very interesting idea okay everyone is now locked in GitHub this is personal account and you reached again the is this URL reference and then you can Fork click on Fork on the right and it asks you hey in which um which owner should be selected to generate the forks the individual copy of our course material and I choose Andrew's account here and afterwards I click on create Fork is this is a typical pattern in open source projects we have one repository that is used for dissemination for the representing the actual state of the project and of course I'm not allowed to make changes in the Linux kernel no I have to do my copy to generate my copy can Implement some new fancy features here and then I ask GitHub to combine or to compare them based on reviewer results then the very merged afterwards and you have to run through this test and stuff like this so yeah it's interesting aspect now is we have Five Forks this is fancy okay good count um and we can probably just to inform it's a generation or programming is in social thing nobody think about but it's and you have a kind of stars here so if you like a project you can add some stars and so it gets more attraction for other contributors to participate in it okay I have my local fork and I can see its changes here and now we can use it yeah yeah so one thing uh probably I just show you there's this basic editing mode uh just for probably to the uh read me preview where's this editing so you can basically also edit it in here so but though dude so amid some flowers commit changes so you can add more explanation to it common changes take some times and we added this stuff and are probably from my Fork want to put this back onto it so there is this opportunity from the website like your contribute open a pull request so which means I changed the title so it goes back to from my local repository Andre ditri back to the Leah script playground so create a pool request checking everything is done it's approved so okay I am the maintainer also of the the program I can have a look at the changes  or much more foreign exhibition said you can have this conversation okay change this or you have to use this format but I'm fine with this and simply isma 10 and now okay allow this changes to be pulled back into the main Repository confirm merge so I got a name and if I go to my repository they are now those changes within so just like so this is a way of incorporating or working with multiple editors or authors but what you can do now is probably hit the dot button or probably go to and this will okay this is not allowed in here and so now in the online editor of GitHub which is basically a vs code editor and there's this possibility so you can also edit your code in here so you have your file structure you can upload images so you can open these extensions and there's just a little thing that we will add to the stuff and what is missing is actually we need to tell it to preview Leah script to us so you go to this extension panel and then simply okay I already installed it but if you just search for the script there's this web preview where just click on in your case this will be install and this will install the same preview as in the live editor if so if dot don't work for you you can always change the github.com to github.dev so this is just the dot is just a shortcut so for me it says yes so you have to install that preview so in case the other one is if you're using the vs code editor so all right so I already have all of you also and then you yes yeah and then you install the script preview and this will open Line something like a development server for you within your browser and you can experiment more with the content and the HTML content in this case this is just a tutorial of course we will present you first so online editor afterwards later we switch to your personal installation of Visual Studio code where you have your individuals much more opportunities related to extensions of the editor for organizing table structures and all these things it's I would prefer all the time a local information only one GitHub I think I have to do that in Chrome it is yes to get again a preview we have to install the web preview new scriptweb I'll preview web you need to extend its capabilities by installing an extension  so in this unfortunately I'm not used to this menu and where to find the code but if you simply open your these extensions probably MD just click on it you only have to do it as a shortcut out plus l you see and then your alt L will open the preview same preview as you had it before and now like also if you want to update the preview Leah script new course you have to hit Ctrl s like you did it before and it will update the preview so so we'll create a few technology press enter or no just wait uh so control  this basically that's the same for you but now we have more elaborates editor and you can also will skip the image part but this would be used simply like in a normal editor add a new folder probably call this image and also upload a new file something like an image and then you can refer to this image you can refer to this image within you all the script project in the same way so but because of time issues we'll skip this and I will show you now there's this metadata part so you can adapt this by your own probably so within this HTML comment uh we can add some additional information about the course content so you can probably add in your name in my case I had mine and you will see these meter information is also used here within the course information you know you can add your contact information if you skip this I don't want to publish my email probably so it's gone you can write some comments about what your course content what's the content of your course will be so and this is also the basic default narrator if you want to change the language probably because highlighting is everything is in English you simply add your language shortcut like we have a few translations like in French so this is the course commands and everything so and all the hints and quizzes if you create them they will be now in French or in Spanish or in some other translations that we probably have Within like  do you have a macro you have to click onto the editor  comfortable to open educational resources content otherwise no one will find you interior Generations so now these meter information these are basically like you can think of in this as macros like text substitutions so if I want to refer probably to the author who is the author simply that it's author so macros everything that you define with here you can refer this to the same name like in colon and you simply add and add into it that whatever is written here just use it within here so if I recompile this who is the author it's Andre ditri so this will be reuse this information and in the same sense you can create probably your own commands like bold colon we use a markdown syntax and if we want to add parameters so this will there are no parameters within so it will simply present at author with Andre die substituted that we want to add parameters so we adjust like so there's the one the first should be placed in here so now I can do something like it's bold we add a parameter it's like a bit of coding in this case so we made and ready three bolt as you see and this is just a simple way of how you can create or create your own extensions to the language to the language so like we can also to be more readable call it test hello world at zero and one if we have multiple from nine to ten and we can now just like use this command test we call this www  tones no so in this case it could be also an image that could be so you see it's just like with two parameters just a replacement so you can yeah can you explain why did you use in front of test but it was not necessary or bold ah this is just optional it's just like we use this because author is just like uh and it's a macro that is actually used within the system or used on different places like in the information place and this is just a way of basically they are the same but you can distinguish this stuff a bit more if you're just like these are custom ones and these are system based macros that you want to import so yeah so not different and this could be also include HTML content this could create a JavaScript content this could create anything so they are a bit more functionalities like importing scripts that you want to load afterwards but if you go to so there's a you can have a lot of complex additional functionality and you want to reuse this in different courses right so there's this or on the layerscript website they should be open source your list of courses see a list of templates that's referring to a bunch of layerscript projects where we can probably this is just an example if you want to do a course about AVR programming so there's a course that adds some additional functionality foreign  there's nothing fancy in there if we look at the raw item oh well there's a bit more complexity going on so this implements some kind of functionality and so if you want to import this and this is the basic pattern then you can use an import macro and this is simply referring to this text document you can come copy this add this to your too many and also add this so can you see this I'm simply copy and paste it the content the import statement and then the raw file I'm referring to the same course so this course actually and I want to reuse this functionality within my course so actually nothing has happened because why we are not using this functionality and ideally this like tells him so there's this at AVR sketch that is now as a comment or a macro that they can use in my course and then there's here just a basic example you can copy and paste this write the macro we did this here's the link to the extensions and there's just this is the I can remove this however go to the next part I have this block of code that somehow visualized and it's the same and if I clear script doesn't know what to do with it it's just like uh a building block or something of code and now it's just like I'm like within the quizzes or within other parts I'm adding a script tag that exactly tells how to deal with the input so now it's in executable piece of code where you can so the code gets compiled or sent to another instance it's compiled there on the web service and everything works well and yeah of course I have now just an Arduino serial terminal where I can just type in so it reacts on different inputs like test enter so it's unknown or send enter unknown so identified this case but you can do also more complex examples probably if I want to program in LED copy and paste this here are some descriptions of an LED images Ctrl s so this is now executable and there's another one another executable block so now these turn into LEDs with some pin in pin out of the description and I can do the same yeah take some time as you can now have this terminal output the LEDs are switched on Switched Off I can change the code probably increase the speed recompile this and it's now faster than this and you can simply turn change the code in here send this to your students and yeah that's basically the idea that's the idea of adding macros into it so if you want to if you can look by your own through this list of additional templates or functionalities that could be used absolutely what is here the game if you want to embed some 3D Imaging possibly I won't save also the functionality from this course content I'll close this so I can import this specific markdown file which extends additional functionality about iframe so nothing has happened and other some examples so this looks a bit different so we can copy this scene probably now let's add this to the top so it looks a bit different about this and we have defined and 3D scene in our frame probably you can load also other stuff in the same way it goes with a music annotation chemical uh libraries and stuff like this they are just self-explaining documents that you can use that implements some kind of functionality as you have seen it with these macros and that you can re-import into other courses the extent where this functionality so just like since we offer programming we want to build extendable libraries extend the language and the capabilities and that's just one way for us how we solve this problem so that we can reuse functionality a couple of times any questions so far was it two I can send you the code if you want to you can copy this into your yeah and if I'm fine now with the with my changes with my adaptions I just can click this I change this Source control there I have some have been some modifications okay what has changed I can review it and I want to stage changes addition to another am I doing right so that some Macross just some information that helped me to identify those changes and then commit and push so now there's nothing more to commit if I go back to the main Repository dot com we have updated this extension version and if you want to share it you can now directly share it as you've seen it from GitHub just go to the Raw copy the text file you can go to the Leah script website you can either either add simply the URL of your your markdown file to the course it will be loaded we have this not so beautiful structure we have this extension so this is working from there is nothing more you can use it to program and that's it we don't pay for anything it doesn't cost us anything you can share us create as many courses as you want to GitHub is just a nice and easy way to cooperate with others to directly host your content to update it quite fast and easily but you can use also your own solution or your own gitlab or it could be a web server it could be a Dropbox it could be anything all like in web.3 Technologies probably Sebastian will talk about you can use also like fancy protocols like ipfs or I will skip this with a tour and onion Share tour Network stuff like this but yeah questions so far yeah I mean obviously you are Mr leader Scripts you know because I see your Woods repository from GitHub the recordings and so on from the from the YouTube videos Etc um can you tell us maybe a little bit more about the community because the script was not invented by you but eventually you put it into the educational context because a community is a hard thing because we publish it and once we had before the corona crisis we for example had yeah we did some meetups we taught this to some teachers and during the corona crisis we saw an increase of the usage by just by visiting this Google has called Google analytics website but then another professor told us he cannot use the content from another University I've never heard of him uh that he creates courses for the script but he cannot use it in his lectures if there's a foreign the data or usage or something on a foreign server he's not aware of or something like this so and we skipped everything so we have no idea who's using it so there's a guitar chat I added this to the information at the beginning so and then there from time to time we receive emails from people we haven't even heard of them we don't thought that they are using this to create their content and sometimes they impress us with because it's a language they go through all the tutorials and what is there and they create some new functionality which we thought in oh damn we didn't thought this is actually was possible actually so they also teach us something new so but the communities might yeah we try to build up a community but we are more into the programming stuff and not the socializing stuff for basketball since it's gone so as it's open actually it's called via scripted from time to time there are some so this actually can also host the website by your own there are some pool requests these are not special but there are is
ues some are open some are not close in this case but they are we're at time with people actually voice responsive voice checks so wait a second it's a closed one show solution so it's a like an open discussion actually where some people they might add some functionality that we add to Leah script and there's also discussion it would be nice to have this specific feature is this possible and then randomized quizzes you started with first and then we discussed this topic online so what would be a good choice because it should be there for the next hopefully couple of years and then there's an open discussion and by the time we also okay this is useful and we implement this feature some rights via Twitter some from different sources it's yeah yeah I am so in the beginning so I didn't know until now that I'm you know because I think it is really like an awesome shop and you should you know like load your own about that development I think it's also really a lot of issues and everyone in the oer series should know about the responsibilities I really think yeah but everyone and they always like divided they are using this platform they are using this tool they are used to use it like in this way and hard to convince and we don't do it by force it's just like we step by step we are building on Leah script actually and hope by the time to convince more more people to use it basically and there's foreign we can host content for free probably thousands of courses without any costs from different sources we can have multiple authors it doesn't cost them yeah of course they have to at their manual label creative labor but we can use it also offline I mean we have no cost with this distributed way of creating online content and implementation officer small mobile it would be helpful to understand the chances of local towards the Escape courses and probably the easiest one is to show it in YouTube afterwards until I have the but I guess one of the key problems is of course the mapping of courses exists now in different languages yeah and I guess for both Community it's really important this was motivated by discussions and just a demo so you can also do the programming the same quizzes in there so we keep so we try to everything that's possible in the script should also be possible within resource constrained devices so as you can see this loads loaded the Course once and it's Now offline of course if you use some external libraries or sources with some fancy JavaScript we cannot guarantee this because they probably will not work but basically a script syntax should work on nearly every device actually so this is the idea so the same content the same course on every device no installation you just load it once like a website and can reopen it whenever you're offline and use the chair this way yeah so but then you will need to have a tracking menu and then you have like a certain amount of complications but that would work then with that of course in this way we could adapt to other libraries probably almost stopped the recording right probably and we can talk a bit more informally if you want to
for so long students in Nigeria have relied on the traditional way of acquiring knowledge but head into classrooms even though these has been widely accepted and internalized in Nigerians education of system it has a shortcomings as it limits distance learning it also restricts students teacher interaction to a particular period of time not allowing students go through a subject as often as possible and at their own pace these challenges have now been addressed with the creation of an online digital platform called mobile classroom as championed by Lagos based education technological fam developers the platform and personalized  I think what is very important the cathode is talking about cinematography talking about cooking designs Laureen and rest of them like that some stakeholders speak some more on the merits of the initiative be you adults be you young students otherwise and you can do so in the comfort of almost anywhere is a very good opportunity for me and by  you you

foreign  opportunities that I will see after this program I've learned that I can be a landing management administrator I can be a learning analyst I can decide to venture into being just an e-learning developer I can be a project manager they are so amazing initially I signed up thinking it was just something that's going to be theoretical but on getting to the venue I realized that it's an Amazon program I get to you know classicalize and despite the fact that I couldn't meet up with the program at the Inception I could still catch up the fascinators or a very receptive and you're ready to move my colleagues where who have gone ahead anyway you know work with me around it I guess I'm going to film with the software and I'm glad I actually signed up a long-term plan for me is to take everything I've done here from storyboarding to using the articulate 360 to keep creating content on my own and also to work with others to keep creating content that will work continually enhance learning in my mind I thought it'd be out of place because I thought as might not be very comfortable in class coming in my TV by the end of the day coming to class and feeding all the love and acceptance in the class made me more confident and I decided that you know that you know what I'm staying and finish this program and not think about the challenges of having to take care of a bit for me the driving Factor behind my journey in live Africa's e-learning boot camp was to enable me create e-learning courses to teach virtual assistants and excuse required to the general population but since my training I have in export to a whole lot of things including but not limited to project management instructional design um how to use articulate 360 and a whole lot of mind doing experiences so I came in not expecting so much I just got to stop one of those learnings something but I came here to my greatest surprise it was a well-hearted Learning Journey for me from learning articulates to storyboarding to several things and not just this learning but also them explaining how this each of these things can actually become a source of income or livelihood for everyone when it comes from truly understanding what it is that you're bringing to the table and you cannot know what you're breaking today and you do not also understand what their potential gaps are  one of the awesome things about this leave Africa's Indian boot camp is that aside from teaching us to be learning developers but also being equipped with entrepreneurial skills and even being taught how to make ourselves more employable  foreign  to be able to take this course and meet all these wonderful people and Facilities as well I also want to say a big shout out to agriculture a class on social design and electric cooking has been great for the first time user like me it was very information to create an assignments so a special shout out to Syria ironte and I believe Africa especially the session on LMS Administration I enjoyed every bit of it so I'm saying a very big thank you for your support and all that thank you so much for introducing us to other team learning it took us on the session our introduction to e-learning and really exposed us to failure at various aspects of English and teaching for taking out their time teachers on what we need to understand entrepreneurship and employability skills so thank you very much so if Africa thank you to Mr finna to take to Sarah and everyone who has made this program successful obviously and those cities would come to anybody and everybody because it just it gives you an opportunity to leverage on your residual knowledge which you might not even know that you can actually fine-tune it into something big and what's making money from we partnered with Africa and other technical Partners to facilitate the ethic Program for Young People it's been interesting so far so good and we love the fact that we were able to engage young people in this program the quality of the questions feedback was amazing and we look forward to having this over and over again I will anticipating the outcome the boot plant and the unintended outcomes that will eliminate from this particular approach thank you  [Applause]
my vision is very soon you can utilize 20th century teaching and learning networking the professor I believe in in creativity I believe in innovation but more importantly I believe in technology driven solution as I want to close the gap between the agenda with the e-learning that we have introduced now we've seen the passion coming back into education we've also seen how the divide in knowledge has changed with technology between those don't have I think things are becoming much easier because for the first time in the country it doesn't matter where you are with this introduction of e-learning you can have everybody the best teacher in the country teaching high school has been used as a blueprint of the rollout of e-learning in housing and what if our staff are busy doing now they are actually busy at developing electronic lessons that are used by the five plus two schools that the MSE launched on the 14th of January this year we thought about it will take us almost 18 months just to fine-tune the strategy I'm quite excited that we've included two concluded our ICT strategy so we're investing one was six hundred and fifty million they are not just to train the educators but 77080 the massive we launched this two years ago the Deputy Minister of Education in were certain attended with him was the other new suit and they were quite delighted as to what we've achieved them I still remember her getting paid by the Deputy Minister and general said no you actually pioneers in this round so true in saying that because we certainly a pioneer this space MIB technology is a fantastic company because they as far as I know be the only company to be able to in the world has achieved all of this IP technologies are people that invested and took a risk even before they knew not to take this route and you need to know what people that make that is but besides quality product I must be honest easy to use it's it's the tailor made for the South African society and capable to respond to the challenges that we want both we were very fortunate at us as a revamped three of our classrooms and we call those classrooms classrooms of the future losses are actually responsible for the national rollout of e-learning in the country so we were very fortunate to be able to work with such individuals with a great ability to change this country established in the Academy we want to roll up all the software in all the schools around us in South Africa already we've spoken to three government departments discussing what the importance of eLearning but ocularly will not be at the cutting edge of where technology is going where science with mathematics we innovation entrepreneurship is going at the back but I must say that the children are very enthusiastic to learn at our schools now I think I understand with education making eradicate poverty and we see the enthusiasm that came with it I want to take a South African chart and so you can go to Russia I can go to UK you can go to software here you can go to Brazil India that particular chart must not fear us so the student of the future must not know pandas you

hi I'm Yan gang founder and CEO of Cassie Insight Africa most Innovative research and advisory company focusing on the African markets we offer consumer survey Market insight and data driven advice to our clients Yan one of the big questions for people when they look at Africa from the outside whether they're a Telco broadcaster who whatever how actually how big is the middle class and how do you define it well I think the it's an interesting question since it's a very challenging question so obviously we had different um um estimate that came out uh from the African bank or the standard ched Bank uh all giving estimate based on income we have a different view when it comes to the middle class in Africa we think uh from our point of view it's not just about income because income is very difficult to measure in Africa I think it's about aspirations and we basically did a study inh house to going to assess whether we can Define the middle class in a different way and and now from that estimate how big is that middle class you know in Africa and you know we're coming out with a range between 3 to 6% depending on the countries obviously again it's not a one number F alls yeah it would depend and we also think that the middle class is fluid uh so people go in and out of the middle class uh and you know the idea is to basically have a definition that fits the African contest and basically have a way to track and in some countries it would be more than the 3 to6 absolutely and the other question is actually to do with in a sense willingness to pay and ability to pay and the relationship between those two everybody says these are price driven markets yes what's your take on that well I think my take on that is is is is around value I think I think any uh you know consumer whether it's you know in Africa or outs of Africa has to to to come to a value prop where you know the consumer actually finds value now in Africa I granted we don't have a big consumer a big middle class but it doesn't mean that we don't have people are not willing to purchase they are willing to purchase what they find valuable to them so we did St studies on you know mobile apps for example uh in Africa where you know we found that you know uh Local app developers you you know we complaining about you know local people not downloading the apps well guess what uh it's not because your app is made in Africa that people are going to be basically download it no if the apps is valuable to them then they will basically download and then they will use it so you know I think you know what kinds of things were they saying that they found valuable so you know going back to mobile uh you know things that they found valuable you anything around Health um so we did a gap analysis where we asked people you know do you have health apps on your phone at the moment and then would you pay for any help so we had a positive gap of 7% so the the difference between people who say that they have the health and then they want to buy was a positive positive 6% same idea for business related apps where the Gap is even larger so if you look at an app you know as basic as a f sharing app well guess what it's very valuable for people in Africa so that's why in the report we said you know developers should not uh should resist the tendency of copying and pasting uh not because gaming apps are popular on Google Play or iTune uh means that they will be popular in Africa I think you have to look at the context you have to look at what's valuable for people for users then you basically have to bring that value to them obviously at the proper price point and how does that value proposition work out in terms of devices you know particularly things like smartphones or tablets more high-end devices how how is value perceived there I think the more you look at the highend obviously the more um um um comp complex the usage is going to be so a smartphone would be used as as a computer for example where you know obviously people would do way more than just talk on the smartphone we you know we look at Financial Services uh like in East Africa uh and you look at you know media in terms of video content and and and whatnot so as you go up the the ladder I would say in terms of the device you know your value proposition or your the usage is going to get more complex but it doesn't mean that it's again it's a one- siiz fit all because we also find that there are in certain countries clear segmentation meaning it doesn't mean because a user has a smartphone that basically the smartphone is used for entertainment meaning any content app you build is going to work no because in some countries people see their smartphone first as a work related item as opposed to a entertainment item so when when you build a product and you you want to use that that user remember that again these people may not be inclined to download your content your videos and whatnot contrast me two countries one of which would use a smartphone for entertainment one of which wouldn't just to give me some sense of the so the personality of that the two the two and it may have to do it may have to do with the with with the samples and one of but one of the you know the big differences where you know if you look at Ghana and you look at let's say Cameroon for example uh GH very big on entertainment like you would see people they would they the view the mobile app smartphone first as an entertainment to it's a Content video um and then uh we actually did Nigeria but the data is not uh available yet um but it will be interesting to see also in Nigeria how is it uh um but then you look at camon for example where it's mostly a work to yes entertainment is not as big uh in Kenya mostly a talk talk to so basically people use the phone to to communicate and then for obviously working and and using financial services and whatnot so as you can see you know you're looking at that those segments and they're not quite identical even if you look at three countries already but it's worth saying isn't it that the you should describe the samples absolutely abut they essentially Urban samples yes they are exactly they are Urban samples again we are looking here at really Urban sample uh between 18 years old and 45 years old so these These are the you know the active uh populations uh people who are um employed and self-employed um and in terms of Gender Gap uh gender uh allocations usually you know 40 between 45 and and 55 uh male and men so so we have uh from that s point of view I think a representation of the urban uh Africa
 donna crock pot is learning a new application that are somehow revolutionized study methods take a look at this report I can see assignments the profit margin to your school assignments in a cell phone even when you didn't have access to the internet sounds too good to be true but that's an award-winning up from chalkboard education and set up at the impact hub in Ghana the omission is to help improve access to quality teacher education in the country higher education should be available to anyone I don't say it's free it's not free you have to pay for the professor's you have to pay for universities but you shouldn't be paying for the rest if you don't have the time to go on campus you should be able to access the classes and to be able to do assignments and to pass the test and to get a degree at the end that's what we want to do the french department of the university of ghana is currently signed onto the app given students access to their coursework and assignments of campus on their cell phones the application when downloaded can be used of line so you don't need a connection to access your content because the content is already on your phone the only thing we do is we use SMS and ussd for for instance when you have an assignments to answer they can send you and so directly by SMS we have a system of arrival algorithms short codes allow us to track a different kind of information thousands of university applicants do not get that method due to limited resources and facilities among other reasons Adrian believes no one should be left behind want to help universities to develop elearning for outside campus students later but right now because we're in a pilot phase and we are trying to make it work better it's simply more effective and quicker to to do that with students on campus the innovation was awarded the best setup in Ghana in twenty sixteen bytes it stars a global company I warden startups and emerging markets chalkboard education steam is made up of five different nationalities and the target is to extend the app to test your institutions across the continent

hi my name is brenda nyakoa i come from nairobi kenya i work at the international rescue community i'm excited to be here for the e-learning africa conference i'm looking to interact with as many people as possible as i've realized there's a lot of um interesting products in edtech and to learn about what people are doing to make sure that these products are being used in our communities the right way so i'm really excited to meet all the people who are teaching i'm super excited about alison being here today i think from all the communications i've had so far access is coming up a lot but i must say also just a lack of knowledge of available opportunities and platforms that people can utilize there's also a major barrier here and from speaking with people locally and they are always asking what are the opportunities for learning what are the opportunities for resources available that they can use people are not aware of these resources and i think we need to do more on advocating for this product and providing accurate information on where i believe young people right now are taking up ownership of their learning and i think by having a platform like alison they can access any learning material that they can have and unfortunately in africa we're not always updated on content and related careers so at least one could be that platform where they get the latest in terms of education that is available globally so that would be great to improve the skill set that we have in our
at would actually save a lot you see this is an African scholarship right yes um there's something called jof and ausi and what is the other one p ah poundo right yeah do you ever to find this product uh these products in in Glasgow this being a foreign country okay in Glasgow there are number of African Stores um I haven't been to one but I know friends do have um and even if you want to get some there are some items some um maybe some vegetables that are not common to like the local stores you can find in some Asian stores if there aren't any African stores close to you so there's usually like an Asian or yeah an Asian just is thr through and um the question about doof or having food available they are also food delivery services so there are people who cook food and deliver that's is this is African based food J Love pound um egies stews like soups different soups and um about restaurants African restaurants I don't know of any there might be although I did visit one in Edinburg Edinburg um if you um this weekend and they had like swallows and um pounded um jellof fried rice I believe there would be in glasgo I just have sear they are in Glasgow I know them it's only that I can't mention them here but they there is quite a number of them in Glasgow so so that serves to the benefit of The Listener that they can always come here and continue with the same more or less same lifestyle before they pick up things now for you to come to the UK there's one document that you need it's called a Visa y you applied for your Visa right yes who paid for it um I would say fun from my parents and my yeah okay so it's you and your family right yes what do I need for me to apply for a Visa after I've been awarded um there's something called confirmation of AC acceptance of studies right C yes so that usually comes after you have been given an unconditional offer a unconditional offer for your Masters yeah so you received your C and now what so um okay so I would say the application process also is quite seamless um you go to the UK government websites and or you can just do a quick search for like visa application you or student visa application then it literally takes you to their page where you can start the process um it'll asks you questions like your name your school it asks you to feel um to upload your cast as well if you have at this point at this stage if you have like a scholarship you can also um upload it um it ask you for a maintenance fee um so the maintenance fee differs so for Scotland I think the rates is a bit cheaper than London um and it will asks you to ensure you have this amount of money in your account for if certain period maybe one month I can't remember the exact period but for a certain period you should have that amount in your bank accounts cuz that is what the UK um the people that check that vets the Visa would check against and migration the home office yeah the home office migration office and so far you're able to prove your funding and if you have like a scholarship that pays all of that many maintenance so far if you upload the document it's also the same process like you upload if you still need to pay the maintenance fee you upload your bank statement saying you have it if you don't you upload the document saying it's been paid for um you upload your cast that's the fact that um the cast document stating or the university has giving this admission um and uh yeah your course that you you have maybe if you pay the setting fee if you have tuition fees to pay it to be stated on the Cass um and it's a literal straightforward process I did not have need to have any I didn't have any issues like deciphering anything so there's one thing that I don't know if you did this but um you may want to Pro that you can fund your your stay in the UK you know it it's going be expensive right mhm and the home office so those are the people are giving the Visa may want to understand if this person can manage to fund their stay on the other side were you in any way required now that you are given a part a full fee scholarship were you in any way required to provide evidence about that you have this this amount of money in your account you mentioned for you you have to hold the money for some time right so what what evidence do they need do you need to go with the money to the home office when you are applying or what what are you supposed to do oh well you don't need to carry the literal cash to the home office no you just need to show um it in your bank statement that you would have uploaded like before going to the Embassy for any capturing or before submitting your Visa I mean your passport so just your bank statements and it's fine so in short I need to hold the money in my bank account or the bank account of somebody who is going to like my parents right yes like you yeah okay now that is that is very clear I know this it is usually a complication because this evidence can kind of a thing is just a a whole a whole disaster now the final bit is here now you've been given your Visa you went to is it is it Legos or Abuja Legos so you took your flight to the to the UK right yes where did you where did you land right I Lear okay um I so I leared at glasgo or through a connect flight from London soos to London then London to Glasgow so could you please help me understand what happened on this first day in the UK uh okay so it was it wasn't my first time in UK um but since I was traveling alone um what happened was to make things really easy since um you're are quite new to the environment um so the university provides a good resource on navigating your way to your accommodation wherever it is so on the website they tell you things on how to get a bus how to get a taxi if you need it um maybe the times that it runs and sometimes they also run these programs where there are invest student Representatives at the airport to get you or help with your luggages and then just help with Direction mhm so I'll say the things that helped me aside from Google Map um I just cuz I was completely new to like to the environment um I once I got my boxes out there's literally series of taxes lined up for you so you can pick up one and just go directly to your accommodation pretty straight forward or you can do an Uber or um if you know your way around although it's not too hard to locate you can take a bus it takes you to anywhere like literally I think there's usually a bus directly to the city center and from City Center you can locate your yourself like you can get anywhere or you can just get one that is closer to your B stop so and how do you know it's closer to your B stop you can use Google Maps yeah sure make Google Maps your friend yes so it means also know how you will get connected to the internet you said this was not your first time in the UK If I heard you correctly yes so did you experience any culture shocks in Glasgow um in Glasgow mhm well this wasn't also my first time in Grass school um but yeah in CL SCH there's the say of Four Seasons in a day where you can see rain Sun wind and all all in just one day or we did an hour Lally um so as it the first week I got here um I got to experience a bit of Summer a bit like 3 days of summer where the sun was really hot and then you can go you could go out without a cardig gan or anything so it was really nice and um it's also helps ease into the weather so now Glasgow is it's I think it's colder than um London CU by in the north of UK and um yeah I would just say um I would just simply say okay there's a saying what is say it's not bad weather it's bad dressing so you layer up if you're C cuz as Africans we're coming from a very hot country it is very cold yeah it is very cold this is this is winter right yes and um I was just looking the other day it was -6 today today is really hot it is um or when I'm saying it's really hot it is uh 6Â° so so somebody can just gug and see which which works which works for them but yeah that one also caught me and it caught me on the the wrong side you are an international student and your Visa is very likely restricted to the amount of time you can work yes so how many hours are you allowed to work so I'm about to work 20 hours per week yeah um however during um um 10 once St time is over that's during the breaks you allowed to walk up to 40 hours I believe so do you get to work do you work do I work yes I do work ah okay how can you how can you say like in relative to the program is it manageable can I be stud in and working at the same time um yes I would say it's manageable you just need to um learn to prioritize learn to shutle your tasks um so I would just say things that help me having a good calendar um when you have something to do put it on your calendar if you have classes I literally have my classes my timetables on the calendar um you can Define your work hours around it you can also Define um cuz you'll be doing courses and then some courses or I think most or all courses would require some sort of assessment so you'd also want to work towards that and also fits that in your calendar um yeah just prioritizing things having a too list um having an organized calendar those are really helpful things that have helped me and are still helping me in navigating like a school work Balanced Life MH yeah so speaking about that Balanced Life there's something else called social life do you get social life social life um yeah well you you have to make time for it I believe um yes I get Social Life um I mean I I a few friends and I went out over the weekend as at is before the um before we before things get to heat things get heated up like with school work and assessment and even during those times you can actually if you do Define or prioritize your task well you can still make time for things like that you can still make times to maybe go to movies um Cinema um go watch movies um have calls talks go to restaurants um there are places to visit even especially in the University mhm like there are series of streets or restaurants that you can just go to there are parks there are museums there are lots of places to visit as well that even ACC easily accessible yeah so what other kind of support besides financial support do you as Scholars get you are um given a cup of around 15 Scholars for this specific kind of funding right if I got the number correct is there any other support you get besides that do you have like a community do you ever get together and maybe go out to some other place like loon like in Edinburgh to just have fun uh no um the program doesn't hold this type of events for the scholar recipients scholarship recipients yeah okay it is understandable because the objectives of these different fundings are different right yeah now I have listened to you close to the past 1 hour and um I like what you're talking about I'm hoping that one day I'll be a scholar like you in the University of Glasgow but I also want to know how things work out with you now during your Masters after your Masters what you're going to do and how things are I would love to connect with you how do I connect with you okay you can connect to me on LinkedIn and um I also have a gethub profile it's um geop.com Buu do I mean yeah Buu Das T not DOT bu- tare so but you can also check it on my LinkedIn so you can connect to me on LinkedIn and then you see other social media platforms that I am open to yeah yeah so in case you want to connect with her as she has mentioned there's LinkedIn there's GitHub and there's also something nice she's doing for the dev Community it is available on both LinkedIn and Instagram all the links to these profiles are available at the description of this video just check it down there you're going to find all the information you're also going to find the link to the scholarship so if you've truly listened to this conversation you are probably interest interested in this scholarship and you may want to check that out so B for a person who is going to make this application after this conversation what do you have to say Okay um I would say one if you're afraid to do it just do it um but when you're doing it you can for example when you are writing your essays you can vet your essays with people ask people to read it um yeah ask people different people to really tell them tell um to tell you what they think about it um and uh yeah once that is clear once it's good to go and one more thing is yeah AI CH GPT or I any form of AI or llm so when you are writing your essays I would advise not to use only certain only llms like only AI B to just write up or like literally just throw in the question and then copy and paste in the answer cuz if you're doing that imagine um like it may it probably won't be just you that would be doing that so rather than doing that I'm not saying not to use AI you can use AI for good you can use it to um revamp or make your essay better what I'm trying to say or Draw out is you should Define your story you can tell the AI Bots to maybe help to build out your own story like you have your own points you have or you worked as this you did that you did you have this experience you have blah blah blah and you can just tell it oh how maybe you're trying to build up a paragraph about this how do I build it up how do I like that way it is telling your story and not like a generated one cuz one you would also be asked about it during the interview stage and yeah you don't want to seem like you don't know what you wrote or like everything was just made up so there's that and um in your for your interviews like literally it's questions on like tell me about yourself know your why know your why knowing your why also helps with your with with the essays so know your why for the essay and the interviews and yeah good luck so that was Bola Aon and this is the management diary your host today was omay Joseph and until we meet again in the next episode bye-bye"
so listen discuss many benefits for businesses I would say that one is definitely the delivery of consistent subject matter so where the employees trained as a group or individually and regardless of whether they use a mobile phone their computer may be one of our group training units all subject matter is delivered consistently across all platforms second benefit would be receiving training in your mother tongue so lesson days can Able's content creators to upload assessments and content in any language which eliminates the language barrier and then immediately enables the employee to retain that information the progress tracking and monitoring on lesson disc is made very easy by using listen this online dashboard and reporting tool you can track the progress of individuals within your business you can track the participation of different branches within your business you can also see how different courses are performing throughout your business then fourth advantage would be the training is delivered on site not only on site but anywhere and anytime that the employee wants to receive the training so in the post your employees would have to travel to different locations or you would have to get trainers out to come and deliver the training at your offices but with lesson desk doing it anywhere anytime saves you time and money then it offers career pathways so what I mean with that is that it allows you to structure subject matter as lessons courses and curricula you can then assign that curriculum to any predefined role within your business so listen this is not just a normal ear learning platform it's an end-to-end training partner so the journey starts with employee screening then it goes through to onboarding formal training and finally the exit interview encompassing human resource management as part of the solution so apart from the obvious financial benefit to our clients I think the one thing that stands out is the empowering effect that laserdisc has had on employees this has become very apparent in the feedback that we received from our clients I think we can all agree that competent well trained employees translate into better employee retention as well as better customer service absolutely listen this is very versatile in the number of learners it can handle some of our clients trained as little as six employees on the system while others use it to train more than a thousand employees we have really racked up some impressive numbers of the posture currently we're training more than a hundred thousand employees per month we have already perfected the transition from paper to digital learning but we are continuously looking for ways innovative ways to optimize this transition so our next goal would be to make client content digitization even more streamlined and efficient we will also be looking at ways to cut down on production time and production costs this will be done by using our content break media structure which basically allows for content to be built up from individual elements

so you would want to start teaching online but you don't know where to start you don't have any sort of experience or you don't know exactly where to go first and then I've got your cup if you're from South Africa or you are from any other country but you have a neutral accent but you don't have any experience no degree but you do have a tefl certificate and if you do not have a telephone certificate I will advise you that you start getting one now because it's totally free to have a tefl certificate with teacher records go to tutorial cards and start applying for telephone certificate so let's go to the first company that will hire you even though you don't have any experience of teaching online even if you don't have any qualifications at all the first company that we're going to talk about today is called all right already stated based in the U.S and they are looking for people like you so to apply here it's quite easy you just go and apply them if you have made it they will send you an email to let you know that you can go for an interview you after they have interviewed you which will take 10 minutes for the interview then you can go to the following stage of their training then after the training you can start teaching over here so what are the requirements to actually make it here their requirements are you must have a case a tefl certificate but they don't require you to have any degree like I said you must have a telephone certificate or experience of working so you must have either one of those things and anyone can apply from any other country as long as you have a neutral accent we need you to work from your laptop or desktop your laptop must be at least a full GB and they pay you every two weeks you are expected to teach 15 hours each and every single week so you can work those 15 hours if you can but if you want to make more you can make more but the minimum hours that you are expected to teach on this platform is 15 hours each and every single week the amount that you can make each hour is ten dollars per hour and you can get paid via PayPal so now let's move on to our second company and check executive what is the name of your company and what are the requirements and how can you start teaching from this platform so our second company for the day is called land light land light is also expecting you to have a teaching experience of two years they also want you to have teaching certificate but they don't require you to have any degree to start teaching on their platform but I will advise you to go and do at least a teaching certificate if you do that and then you combine it with a reduction video then you can kill it you are also expected to teach at least a group of people or you can do one-on-one sessions and the amount of money that you are making will be determined by your session if you having a one-on-one session then you can make an amount of ten dollars per hour but if you are teaching a group of people then you can make twelve dollars a per hour on this platform so they want you to at least they have a business background and you are expected to work 10 hours per week so you can make more money here if you want but the minimum hours they want you to work is 10 hours so if you want to make more money then you can start working more hours than that can work for like 15 hours 20 hours 40 hours it is up to you entirely but they just want you to at least the work 15 hours every single week now let's move on to our third company called novakit novakid is also hiring South Africans they also take native English speakers including South Africa if you are from outside of these countries which is you know UK Canada Australia U.S and South Africa but you have a neutral accent even though you don't have any qualifications or you don't have any sort of experience you can still apply novakid wants you to have a degree they want you to have a one-year experience and you want you to have a teaching certificate you can expect on this platform to get paid via PayPal and you can make 16 dollars per hour up to 25 dollars per hour you are required to work 20 hours every single week so they do need you to have a degree but you can see that you can make a lot of money because of your qualifications now let's go and move on to our third company which is Nico Encore is an online English school that is based in Philippines and in Japan they hire most nationalities they take every single nationality we do not need you to have any sort of qualifications whatsoever you must be over 18 years old and they take any nationality as long as you have a neutral accent their payment though is very low you can start making an amount of two dollars per hour up to ten dollars per hour this will be depending on your experience and your teaching like your teaching experience as well as your qualifications and your tefl certificate if you have one so hence I'm saying that if you have a telephone certificate maybe you can make more than two dollars per hour but they start you with a very low amount of money but they don't require you to have any other qualifications or experience at least that's great especially if you want to start a teaching career and you are looking for something better but you don't have experience yet this is where you can start knowing that you can then in the future future start doing your telephone certificate and gaining experience and then you can go to companies that will offer you more than this so they do pay on a monthly basis they will pay you via Pioneer or PayPal you choose which option you want to use and they do provide material so you don't have to worry about which material you are going to use for your students so all you have to do just to be available to start teaching now let's move on to our company which is the company it was a little bit difficult to find this company it is called antori so you'll have to really dig in order for you to get to their website but you can go online and search for antori I'll put the name of the company on the screen in order for you to qualify to work here what you need to have is no experience no qualification and you get to be paid nine dollars according to their website that's what they offer they also offer one-on-one classes mostly the company about and Tori and saying that they were offering them two dollars three dollars or five dollars per hour and some teachers did decline in these offers according to their website they say they pay nine dollars per hour but according to people's experiences they say they have been offered lower than that amount but it is based on people's experiences some people do take the offer and some people don't take the offer because they feel like it was too low due to their experience to apply for nine talk 15 you have to go through teacher records and look for nine talk 15 and then you can apply from there but now let's go and check their requirements what is expected from you and what type of students you will be teaching on this platform so you can teach students that are from the age of 12 years old and older like adults and it is possible here to work from 2 am and 4 am in UK time because of the time difference with China the sessions here are 25 minutes long and you work 40 hours per month that what is expected of you but as you know you can work more than this you can work full time or part-time it is up to you they don't need you to have any sort of experience or a degree but they want you to at least they have a teaching certificate so they also offer seven to eight dollars a per hour so guys those are the companies that you can go for if you start want to work make money online without any sort of qualifications but you are interested to start your journey in teaching these are the companies that you can go to and then start making money for yourself but I will emphasize that go and do that teaching certificate duffel certificate if you don't know how to go to teacher records and then apply for free one you won't pay anything thank you so much for watching I'll see you in my next video till then bye thank you foreign
hi friend i hope you are good in this video we are going to look at how to get access to e-learning account what i mean is how you can be on the e-learning platform of your school as a student my name is afrika and i'll be your instructor for this lesson if you have not yet subscribed to this youtube account i will urge you to do so and also don't forget to press the bell button in order to get notification whenever we drop a new video we can also link up on these social media handles in our previous video we learned that e-learning platforms allow students to communicate with instructors it is also important to note that each student is connected to the platform through a personal account this account helps them to communicate or interact with instructors and also among themselves students without account cannot be on the e-learning platform let's look at the following things concerning the e-learning account creation so we are going to look at account creation and then account details now it is your school which is supposed to put you on the e-learning platform so your school is going to create an account for you after the creation of the account they will communicate to you on the creation of your e-learning account and then your account details so this communication will be done through your portals emails text messages even on the notice board or sometimes on the e-learning platforms themselves so the first page of the e-learning platform will have instructions on how you can get your account details your account detail will have username which can be your index number which is common and then um or it can also be your email address which can be your institutional email address or personal email you also have a password it can be a random password or your index number so you see some institutions choose to use your index number as your default password and you are expected to change the password on your first login to a password you are comfortable with note that this is very necessary if you don't change your password and someone else is able to log into your account anything the person will do with the account is in your name some institutions also allow their students to log into their e-learning platform using institutional emails so on the first page they'll be instruction on use institutional email or use your personal email to login as well all these things are going to be looked at in our next videos let's demonstrate on what we have learnt so far so i searched online to get some e-learning platform addresses in their country if your school's e-learning address is not here don't worry just have to search online you get it there are a number of them i couldn't write all of them so just um locate that and then you can work with that you can use that for your practical so i got a number of them so model.uw.edu.gh e-learning dot vvu.edu.gh so you can see that some institutions use model dot others also use e-learning dot just find out what your school's e-learning platform address is you can use it accordingly but let's say i want to visit the e-learning platform of my school i open my browser of course with internet access and then i will type on the browser um model.wuc.edu so i'm typing the um e-learning platform address of my school which u.s will be different depending on the school you attend or e-learning dot e u dot e d dot g h whichever whichever address you get as that of your school you can use it so i type and i search and it opens the e-learning platform of my school for me a very nice one of course what you are supposed to look out for is to look for log in so i locate log in and click on it now when i click on login it opens the login page for me and they are asking me to enter my username and my password let's look at something interesting here so there is an instruction at the bottom is this your first time here that's the question and they are saying that as a student please log in with your index number as the username your index number is your default password so here they are making things easy for us they are saying that your username is your index number and then your password which is your default password is your index number so you are going to use your index number for both the username and the password of course when you log in the first time you are supposed to um change your password to secure your account so i enter my index number and i've also entered my my index number as my password i click on login and it opens the page for me so on the page i can see a number of courses it means that these are the courses i'm supposed to work on within the semester so i can see signs 205 a science 505 each and then i can see land survey geo206 and so on and the instructors who are going to teach these courses are also listed here so this is one of the possible things you are likely to see now if you don't see it like this then you will see something like this here the courses are not provided in the list form but they are in grid so it has been arranged in boxes like that and each box on the page is of course just like we saw in the previous slide um the course being listed so look at this where my cursor is you can see signs 242 which is a course so when i click on it it will open that concrete for me we are going to look at those stuffs in our next um video you
is a half of the society uh that means girl's wife girl's mother girl's daughter and girl is all of the te for the society and when there is no girl the society couldn't be extr important it's one thing to have good information it's another thing to put the information where people can access it that's where platforms become important so you have to create a platform that is both relevant but also accessible I would want to imagine that young women can be able to click and read about they can click and read about the women soldiers in Dome they can click and see the women who played an important role in in resisting colonialization click and listen to the music of media MBA that is the best way to Mentor young women music and media and this kind of stimulus is is is become a much more prevalent aspect of the livelihood of children so it's uh really important that we we do Target ICT at the school level because it can be used to bring new and modern educational resources to students as well as new and modern uh pedagogical approaches of conveying Knowledge and Skills to to students this will provide students in Africa with a Competitive Edge that students in other parts of the world enjoy as well as the resources that they have gender equality means recognizing and valuing whatever contribution a woman chooses to make to society it is not about tick boxes it's not about you know 50/50 it's about saying if a woman chooses whatever she chooses to do with her life Society needs to respect that and value that as an equal and important choice the more stories you hear about women who are doing stuff on their own and following their dreams and doing what they want to do I think it's inspirational and whenever you know someone says but you're a woman you can't do this you can point to that lady and be like she did it so why can't I African development cont

their Sidney for other kinds of engagements what's that's a nice as a frame kind of to continue the debates let's move on to the next lines and the baby we should take a ring this time unfortunately Mohammed is not with us today but I see that's quite a nicely worded text there from him but his Asian Ari would you like to joke huh oh yeah most definitely um the curiosity that occurs with our orange t-shirt made it very easy for us to interact with people for them drug questions and I think just the color made it attractive for people to come and just talk to us I do know that it was easier for me to approach quite a number of people they especially at the exhibition area and we didn't have to do much so that record my reflection about having that calf would you like to say about your cart you know I like the fun part so you do yours Thank You Irene is now I was pretty much impressed with the basically the overall slick and comprehensive organization of the event itself arm and there was quite a lot of information around in various formats in printed formats and digital format and that really helps people to take advantage of all that was an offer and really really there was a huge amount of information on offer there in all sorts of sort of workshops one-on-one collaborative things panel discussions they were vendors they of different services service providers so it was really a very large event with many many many participants you and on day one we had an academia track our Nicola would you like to speak about this for a little bit I sure can so each day I think had academia track and what I expected to find was more research but I found actually that the presenters mainly spoke about actually what what there were the presenters from Rwanda and Tanzania and in this track about what their institutions are doing in terms of distance education and online education so presenter from Rwanda he said you know basically that his institution was was there were they were starting with rolling out some form of online program and then the presenter problem of al-mustafa is writing the potential from Tanzania about what they were doing but Ruth Saburo no I think from my career universe in Uganda she I think really stood out because this was I think the most research early from this track and she spoke about students perceptions or potential students perceptions about what distance education is so many students see it as studying away from home not necessarily still staying at home and studying online and that there was also sort of gendered interpretations of what distance education faint and that ITT access to ICTs and what kinds of sort of tools students were using potential students also differed according along gender lines so that that was really fascinating to me and yeah so let's move on to more highlights Gabriel Gabriel do you want to share your reflection after women's empowerment session sorry I see he's disappeared um I think Alice when she was my cousin and I said look I can hear me alone okay um I chaired this session really interesting and useful session and it covered their center serve a wide variety of interventions that are being carried out in different spaces to empower women starting with the girl Charles Caroline from Tanzania has a project called absent walls where they target young girls and teach them coding and she speaks about technology in that place as a silver lining not a silver bullet but she felt that there's a need from these young girls targeted early to to teach them about and difference in the technology space so that they can they can achieve change and develop and hopefully aspire to be part of the 11 percent of women that are in the fortune 500 state and the 5 percent that are involved in tech startups and to try an increase in percentages and we had also a presentation from Rick who they said the Akina Institute in Ronda which is an organization that is has been developed to educate and empower women it's very interesting models that they use which has been developed in alignment with Rhonda's move towards competency-based education and the women at these institutions are the sensitive basically given opportunities left educators around issues that are linked to needs in the market my opinion is a very ambitious and innovative idea that's rich idea is that dream big and start working towards a demon that would come into being and then there was an a very interesting presentation by some when he looked at stereotyping in the tech space and we talked about the fact that despite that there's a need to bring women more and more women on to the tech space the reality is that there are lots of things about technology that our action barriers to women in bridging that digital divide and we had some very interesting conversations and learnt about the various stereotypes within technology that I'm not necessarily empowering for women and and in terms of it's about the gender bias in technology and the fact that in general people feel that male Tech is better and that males are brilliant engineer as opposed to I think you that everyone to them it's nice  I'm wondering if I should take over here on this Irene was too quickly a little bit it over time now I hope it's fine for our participants that you would like to just they stay a little bit longer all right I attended a session with the with the founder of there was a lot Moodle day quite nice it was quite perfect but we had some very nice interesting sessions with we endure from my Korea University and 884 incur from Tanzania Open University at low rates I hear from young probably made a spelling mistake there must see no University in Kenya or speaking about like how they were using Moodle as a basic element in a system lms and I think main takeaway which I hope was a point that also came across or other participant is that one thing is good to have been good LMS but also that you have a supporting structure surround it's a technical support and someone to also provides actual confidence and I think that I think was great I missed a bit that the other open-source LMS systems like Moodle we've been represented as well but who knows maybe next year should we want in the next month ah yes of course I was going to support someone who was presenting about African games so this is Christian he's from Ghana he did a masters on serious games and education and this particular game was about called hello nurse developed in Ghana and it's Bart Ehrman larrya more specifically his master's was on when you know when a games incorporated in the curriculum the majority of the teachers you know had actually never played a game before they didn't quite know how to do it so the sort of challenges around that but it was it may spoke a bit about it's basically the teachers done not to incorporate into the curriculum but we he also spoke about African game design challenges faced by this you know possess an emergent emerging industry in many African countries and where they are you know also it's got huge potential for in educational spaces especially you know serious games but their limited budgets for development and we're looking to see how we might network exchange sort of work in the space just sort of to change the narrative around African games and to create awareness about the variety of games out there that are locally designed and how this can help challenge representations of what people understand as an African game also to look at games that use local cultures and stories to create games that are designed for local audience yeah so and they'll share some information about this game for anyone who wants to to play it oh hello nurse as developed by little arts so I noticed some folks had to have to leave okay so his name is Christian and I'm sure if I say his name I'm probably gonna say it wrong his full name so I'm going to share his details on Twitter I'm Twitter I'll do that just now that's weird I hear Tony a meeting face to face meeting in a venue next to my office okay um I guess I'll share that just now the Jerome there is a lot of literature on that I don't think and I'm thinking that we might also be able to share okay so I take well great you guys feel free go ahead in the text chat and something that I thought was really fascinating was in the epoca initiative they had a stand at any learning Africa it is about it's a basically a sort of scalable a portfolio system and margarita University colleagues they're going to be implementing it soon it because co-funded by the horizon 2020 program of the European Union yeah and there's a big drive the sort of driver behind this equal values is around employability of graduates and sort of getting students to demonstrate there is skills for the labor markets I'm looking forward to hear from Paul meander and colleagues from our career later on yeah just how things are going you all right and I also had Laura our director she was one of one of the keynotes I've been talking for a while so maybe I should hand over to thanks Nikola yes sir as Nicholas said we have Laura here on the left one of the keynote speakers at the conference and also presenting together with Sakina who talked to us a little earlier on about all the work that they've been doing and that they've been investigating and researching so that was really really interesting to hear that and funny enough to actually go all the way 4

hi I hope you are good this video is to help you log in to your e-learning platform for the first time this is possible if you have already activated your institutional email what I mean by activation is that you are able to log into your email so if you want to log into your account for the first time the first thing you're supposed to do is to log into your institutional email account so you open your browser and you type in the rid of you gmail.com and this is the procedure to open your institutional email account so you click on it if you have a good internet connection the gmail account option login open so it's opening we can see on our screen alright alright so it opens and we are asked to provide our email address in this box as you can see on your screen so you type in your institutional email address and it there we go so an anecdote could you don't 99 ad student but UCC dot edu gh so when you are done entering your email address you hit on next and it's asking us to enter password so you enter the password for the institutional email address and hit on next then it opens the inbox of your institutional email address for you so this is your email accounts as their inbox now what you are supposed to look for is a message from learning management system as you can see so may have my message LMS admin releases ect learning management system account reader so I have received a message from the learning management system so if you see any message like this you are supposed to open but in case you don't see any message like that in your inbox then what you are supposed to do is that you are supposed to look for this video how to get use name and password for e-learning account let's say when you checked in your inbox you didn't see any message from the learning management system then you cannot continue to use this procedure you have to look for this video how to get user name and password for easy learning account so that you'll be able to know how to retrieve your username and password if you have not received any message from the learning management system but in case you have received and you can see on your screen like I can see mine then what you are supposed to do is to open this email that was sent to you by the learning management system so I open it and it opens like this so as you can see on your screen the email has been opened and I've secured two important things these are the important things in the email now the first one is where we have the red circle it contains your username which is your index number and then your password now this password was generated by the system for you so it is a password that the system has sent you and you have to make use of it now the next circle is a name to where you will log in and we'll come to that so what you need to do with your username and password is that you're supposed to copy your password and keep it somewhere you really decide to write it down on a piece of paper I know that your index number of course be in your mind so there is no need to write or copy it but if you don't have it in your head then you may have to write it or copy it but what is more important is your password so the next thing is that after writing your username and password down you come to where we have the green circle you can see that there is a blue link over here when you click on the link it will take you to the log in option of the learning management system someone may also decide to stop here open another tab and type using C dot edu douji each and then you look for email it was to take you to the same place so we are supposed to click on this blue in that green circle so that you take us to where we are supposed to log in to our account so there we go alright so this page opens for us and we are supposed to provide our username which is an indexed number and then the password that was sent to us from the Lenny management system so there we go so the index number is day and then the password I copied or I routes down from the email account Inbox so when you are done you hit on log in and we see how it goes alright so this page opens up for the first time because the password you used in logging in was not generated by you so the system wants you to change your password to a convenient one the one you can't remember every time and that is the password you are going to use to log in every time any time you want to log into your account so the first option is that if you want to change that password that was sent to you to your convenient password you are supposed to enter this information so you enter your current password this is the password that was sent to you by the Lenny management system so you enter that one and then you enter your new password the convenient password you want to use to assess your platform any time one to login so you enter boost password so Lessing this is the password I want to use subsequently to log into my account you enter them accordingly but you repeat that password in this box and then that Boronia then you hit on Save Changes now I hit on few changes it takes you to this page now this page is telling us that the change you wanted to make regarding password has been done successfully so it means that now your password is no more what you received from the learning management system but the new password you inputted in the boxes provided so your new password is what you generated so in hit on continue and it takes you into your ill and an account now this box is opening and appearing on your screen the cause this is your first time logging in so that system wants to ask you if you want to take a poll what do you mean by thought is that you want a system to show you some few things on the side but if you don't want it you can end it if you're interested you can hit on next and then it will take you to where we're supposed to educate you on some few things you're supposed to do so I don't want it I'm ending it there it goes now my page opens up like that this is my account this is kind of my inbox this is where I see this is the first phase of my account now here you see a display of all courses things so all these boxes are courses when you scroll down you will see them properly if we rode on 16 or 10 or 11 courses you see 11 boxes or 10 or 16 boxes so the number of courses you have been enrolled in would display over here cause over him now if you also want to see the courses you have been in ruin yourself to put your cursor on my courses and all the courses you have been on route in what PA here you can open the courses from here so if want to check something from Matt one is the route for you just have to click on it or you can go down here and click on the box that has the name Matt's once the roof oh but I can also open it from here clicking on by clicking on the name so I click on math 104 then it opens the course page formats wonderful for me so here the lecturer has not added so many things there is no announcement for me but what the lecture has for me is that topic one is linear equation he has added a book to topic one so he wants you to download this book and study perhaps so if you want to download the book you just have to double click on the book you can see the PDF you double click on it I need to open the book and also download and your system will save it for you so when you scroll down like you can see on your screen you see a display of the other topics formats one though but here we can see that nothing has been added to topic to the factory topic for and so on so the only thing the lecturer has added is topic 1 which is linear equations and you're supposed to click on the material download it and then you can study it now when you want to download you just have to double click on the material and it will be downloaded for you so when he asks something - topic to topic 3 topic 4 it can be a book it can be a PowerPoint it can be pretty F just have to click on it and it will download the material for you to study now in your next login you didn't have to go through this long process you do have to go into your institutional email address to be able to load it what you need to do is that now you know your username which is your index number and you know the password you

Hold On Tight off we go let's find Africa bring your heart write your dreams come with us today Hold On Tight off we go  we are in Africa it is the second largest continent on planet Earth with over 50 countries Africa is home to a billion people look there is the Atlantic Ocean to the west and the Indian Ocean to the east and the Mediterranean Sea to the north I can't wait to explore Africa oh no Marley just lost spaceship parts and they've scattered all over Africa we need to find all the parts before we can fly home to virtus let's keep our eyes open for the missing parts as we explore Africa touch and drag Marley over a place to land Hold On Tight off we go  we are in the Serengeti Plains in the African Savannah what is the Savannah a savannah is a vast open grassland with mostly grass and just a few scattered trees and shrugs Savannahs typically lie between a rainforest and a desert the Savannah gets more rain than a desert but not as much as a rainforest Marley lost six parts in the Serengeti I'm sure we'll find them as we explore the Serengeti tetan object to explore I want to eat in Acacia Leaf too  oh my tongue hurts the thorns on your case have three pulled my tongue don't the Thorns hurt the giraffes tongue giraffes have very long purplish black tongues which they use to try to avoid the thorny outside branches of the acacia tree and reach for the softer inner branches which don't have thorns their tongues are also tough and have a very thick sticky coat of saliva that prevents the Thorns from hurting their tongues in case they happen to eat them terrific you found a fart drag the camera over the giraffe to take a picture

 so we created this game to be user accessible with the color choices that we chose so for example instead of using a white background we actually used the cream colored background with black text which actually allows the text to stand out another thing we used was the animation so for the text we chose the animation of whitee with a effect option go from left to right by paragraph this allows text to come on once per line so for example it would say hello then the user name followed by the rest of the text next line would appear shortly afterwards and again and again this allows for users to be able to read without having to struggle with reading between certain lines and again with the color choice that was a very useful technique that we employed
new leaf technologies presents elearning trends 2020 the new era of connectivity with the new era of connectivity fifth-generation wireless technology for digital cellular networks is already being deployed allowing the proliferation of mobile devices to have seamless access to high bandwidth content SpaceX is leveraging its experience in building rockets and spacecraft to deploy the world's most advanced broadband internet system with performance that far surpasses that of traditional satellite internet Starling will deliver high-speed broadband internet to locations where access has been unreliable expensive or completely unavailable the Dark Age distributed ledger technology artificial intelligence extended reality and quantum computing distributed ledges like blockchain a I extended reality and quantum computing are the catalysts for change and will reshape how we learn vr m r AR and CR are the tools learning designers are using to generate new forms of courses by bringing in digital objects into the physical world one impressive method for improving courses using two AR components known as the generator and the discriminator this helps to facilitate the creation of customized training paths through data analysis constantly AI can take a much broader set of learning variables and quickly turn them into personalized learning paths augmenting the learning experience learning designers are further reaching into a pool of media resources to deliver fascinating approaches to improve the learning experience one such example that we liked is using geo-fenced learning activities restricting content that can only be unlocked in unique locations now this is an exciting approach for induction training adapting game mechanics for certain aspects of games into course design is a great way to educate your learner's we need to present learning in such a way that it actually engages and entertains the learner it captures their attention all while driving home the key points of a learning module remember where boredom wins learning fails learning as a service organizational training needs are constant and learning interventions unnecessary to keep staff competent and businesses profitable learning as a service is provided as an end-to-end solution that encompasses managed services from analysis implementation evaluation content and support for a set monthly fee effectively becoming the learning partner for the clients served this hops the push towards lifelong learning personalized learning momentary learning and just-in-time learning that all seems out of reach a reality learning experience platforms people no longer enroll on two courses the way they used to and we need a way to train and learn in the flow of work what this means is that Aleks P systems have a key set of capabilities it places the learner at the center and it's no longer a top-down driven process learners take control of their own learning paths imagine a learning platform that lets you ask it how do I enter an order and it brings up content that shows you exactly what to do it focuses on delivering a personalized learning experience learner centricity is key in creating the culture needed to change your employee mindsets for continual growth and development content curation and user-generated content content curation is an exercise to continually find filter and share relevant content to your learner's allowing access to these resources all in one place it allows anyone in your organization to gather curate content and make contextual learning material available for everyone's benefit content curation will help your learner's experience constant learning through forums discussion and chats for peer to peer collaboration it is a great stimulator for your learning ecosystem it drives social learning and will help inspire a culture of learning what a great way for everyone to add value we are really excited to have you here today if there is one thing we want you to take away from the e-learning yadava it's to always keep the learner in mind thank you 
so  good morning everyone i hope you all slept well however i realize that some of you may have continued networking last night so we'd like to see a show of hands if there are those that continue to network last night okay excellent so want to thank the organizers providing a great opportunity to continue our networking we know how important that is an event like this it's always through serendipity that you'll meet somebody that you didn't know that you'll plant some seeds for future partnerships or relationships so just in the spirit of that we'd like to continue just for a moment networking i would like you to look around identify somebody you don't know and introduce yourself and basically provide an example of an aha moment that you've encountered over the last few days at the e-learning conference that you'd like to share with somebody else now to keep on time class to keep on time before we do this you only have five minutes and then you'll hear me going like this to sit back in your seat so thank you so i want to i want to thank you for indulging me is the opportunity you unleash people to network what are you going to do so thank you everybody for your attention we appreciate your joining us today everybody well thank you so much now bear in mind you still have a few more hours to meet other people here just to let you know to take advantage of the great resources that are in this room my name is anthony bloom i'm the executive director of the mobiles for education alliance and it's my great privilege to be asked to share a panel with such tremendous and inspirational speakers i want to start by acknowledging the contributions of our colleagues from ministries including the honourable minister from ict and telecommunications paula ingeberry that is joining us today but all the other ministry of education officials and colleagues that are with us you are our superheroes notwithstanding how challenging it is regardless of the setting to bring forward young lives in your countries the fact that we had trying times with covet 19 made it even more challenging so truly our great acknowledgement for the work of the governments and the officials that are here and i think they deserve a round of applause [Applause] i also want to thank the organizers rebecca rosa all the colleagues that were involved in putting on an event the m education alliance we put on our own annual event in washington dc and we know how much time it takes to organize an event this spectacular with hosts as amazing as our rwandan government colleagues so great thanks to the organizers for putting together this event so we'll have i'll introduce our presenters and then invite them to come up and speak and then we'll have time for q a afterwards so please make note of comments or insightful aha moments that come from our presenters so that we can include that as part of our presentations we're going to start with lady miriam jammeh i got to turn my timer off sorry um lady and mary and johnny first of all just having the pure pleasure of sitting with these colleagues for half an hour in the room just finding out about all their amazing work was really a privilege so lady marian jamie is an award-winning technologist just listened to her resume a podcaster and a pioneer in system change she's also a young global leader of the world economic forum and in september 2017 she won the innovation award at the global goals award as a goalkeeper for her work in advancing the united nations sustainable development goals by supporting globally young women and girls businesses and governments she's saint galles born a french british businesswoman with over 20 years of experience in the technology sector she's best known for her motivational and inspirational speeches about girls education through steamed which was terrific i had not heard that acronym before it heard steam with science technology engineering math arts and design so i hope if she doesn't mention it as part of her presentation that one of you in the audience is going to ask for more specifics about the design component because i'm really interested in that and she has traveled extensively in refugee camps to teach girls how to cold how to code and she's on the board of directorship of the world wide web foundation and the newest board member of the itu generation connect visionary board she's writing her first book and if that wasn't enough in like in speaking with her she also has a program called i am the food and again if somebody is clever potentially to ask lady miriam about that it's fascinating the work that she's done so i'd like to invite lady miriam to please join us maybe with a round of applause [Applause]  you can play the video before the video comes i want to thank elearning africa and thank you rebecca and your team for bringing this amazing conference into our continent and doing it in a very consistent way since 2005. so thank you so much you have our endorsement as africans thank you what is i am the code i am the code is it's a global movement its aim is to mobilize government private sector philanthropic foundations and businesses to advance stem education and when we say by by stem education we mean science technology engineering mathematics art and design we're now in 68 countries and so far we taught 18 000 girls how to code it is really important to learn how to code i'm a full stack developer so i'm a coder coding help them with their computational thinking there's a different way of thinking you can see the difference between the girls who are coding and the girls who are not coding their brain has changed you know they can decompose information they understand what i'm talking about but the other aspect also is i want them to know they are the code they have the potential to change their lives it's really important that girls understand what coding is there are so many many coding languages but at the same time i really believe that in this world right now we don't talk about humanity that much we don't talk about as human beings what we can do to change things the i am the code aim is to make sure you are a coder a full stack developer a coder who understands the problem of humanity girls minds are changing systematically they're thinking about you know now i want to do climate change issues but i need to also recycle plastic they understand what the information is about and they take it further with their communities and other girls that's why you see this enthusiasm and this smartness in this intelligence in their mind well the kakuma girls are really special to me because when i came for the first time i just realized that i just i had a similar life i had a similar life i'm not a refugee but i've definitely suffered as a younger suffered as a young growing up in senegal i didn't have attention and then ultimately and then everything will need to be employability which is profitability at one stage they're gonna make money and hopefully uh if they go back home the political situation changes in many many ways at least they have something to hold something is of the world of innovation and technology that's what i am recording is about and that's the mission  every time i see the video i cry so that's night from south sudan let me go she's beautiful right so let me go my slide thank you so much i want everyone to pay attention uh in what i'm about to say because this moment we have right now in this room it's a very important moment for us as a as a continent but also it's a milestone that we have achieved when i do things in the continent i don't think about myself but i think about where we started as a continent and where we are going now so i will talk to you about i am the code which i had the privilege to uh found it in in 2016 but i will tell you why i founded im the code and where we are today so the video you saw right now is a video of young women and girls who are growing up right now in kakuma refugee camp in kenya and if you don't know in africa right now we have especially in kenya alone we have over 600 000 refugees uh who are living in two different camps the first one in dadaab where 97 percent of the people that live in that camp are refugees from somalia and the rest of the country the other one is kakuma again another 250 000 people lives there girls are from south sudan burundi kinshasa and we have now girls from ethiopia so it's really uh you know a terrible a terrible situation for our continent and i think we as africans must think twice now if you really want to have those refugees in those camps so let's think about that but the girls are now coding and they're doing amazing well we'll go through the slides so i founded i am the code in 2016 out of frustration and most of you probably have seen my background i didn't go to school i'm standing here today i'm standing here today as the chief sustainability officer for i am the code and i was like i said i'm the lucky founder of i am the code and i created i am the code because i wanted to make sure young women and girls and boys as well have access to skills they need to have skills if they don't have skills it's not going to work then i decided to found i am the code and really focus on making sure we are focusing on the united asian sustainable development goals and in 2013 i was lucky to sit in the room with global leaders at the united nations everyone was talking about the system about development goals ahead of 2015 before 193 countries including rwanda rectifying the goals to make sure that you know we advance them but we all know that without data and impact we can't really you know show what we're doing as a continent so i gave myself a very clear mission please pay attention to this data because in 2030 you'll hold me accountable for it pay attention to this there is a very serious data and the data now is backed by 37 companies 27 governments across the world including nepal brazil argentina japan and china really pay attention to this number because it's going to happen no matter what it's my mission and i'm calling right now for an emergency in this room we're in a safe place and e-learning africa has put a an amazing uh you know team together also people in the room who are professional uh you know people who understand what i'm saying if you've been following the african ecosystem for the last 20 years like i do you understand that right now we need emergency i need to really pull the emergency button uh for us to know so i don't want to scare you but i'm calling it right now for an emergency and why i'm calling for an emergency time is critical we are wasting time we are wasting a lot of time as a continent but also we have issues as a continent we've covered 19 we also have seen what happened humanely we have let people down young women and girls don't have access to content to infrastructure to connectivity it is really bad and we need to do something about it so think about 1974 when i was born in senegal with no education until my teenage years my early teenage years in the united kingdom where i was a cleaner working bars and hotels and restaurants trying to get myself an education i couldn't get a job so think about that now i'm nearly 50 years old i'm 47 years old today my son is 21 years old the reason why i like talking about time is for us to think about time is critical if you don't do anything time will pass anyway so we need to do something now for our continent for boys and girls all across the world so think about time as you go along today if you think about it over 620 21 young people age 15 and 24 are not in education they're not employment or in training but we have spent so much money in africa doing trainings in trainings and trainings my country senegal is a heaven of projects and trainings and certifications and go inside coming back is time we're wasting time 75 million young people are trained but they don't have any job why they don't have any jobs because they don't have any skills no one will hire you if you don't have skills it's just the truth so i'm here to tell the truth and call the emergency button one of the thing i believe in my life is this i'm not entitled to anything no one owes me anything but if you give a man a fish you'll feed him for a day if you teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime what i'm trying to do across the world right now is to fix the issues the failures we have so having conferences like this where you all understand what i'm saying we need to start helping people by helping them meaningfully the last mile of education must be funded now absolutely now it's urgent fragmented education is destroying the life of boys and girls all across the world not just in africa but in the uk where i live today in my comfortable home but as an african i'm a concerned african i can't sit in my comfortable home in guildford just watching the world burned i can't do that i've got responsibility and a duty for society but also for humanity i'm trying to give back what the united kingdom has given me which is safety a library where i can go and learn how to code seven coding languages so i'm standing here not an amateur on coding i'm here as a full stack developer so i build websites apps and i review codes every single day so i really know what i'm talking about but i did this because i didn't have harvard degree oxford degree cambridge degree all those fancy educations which are making africans useless if you ask me excuse my language it is making us useless because we're not going to serve society my mother's generation my mom is dead i don't know my father but one thing is clear the next 50 years the refugee girls who will be 20 30 40 50 years old need us the africans the intellectuals the connected the privileged the wealthy people the educated ones they have to not make our people the leftovers or have not it's not necessary because we have lands we have resources we have intellect we have connections in this room the collective connections and wealth we have is probably over two billion dollars from my connection to yours so let's think about that skills equal money young women and girls growing up across the world need to have skills if they don't have skills they will not earn any money there is no sense of entitlement people will not give them jobs amazon will come to kenya will come to rwanda if people are not skilled they will not give girls jobs my purpose in life is to educate transform and inform i am sitting in a very powerful position today very privileged compared to where i come from 47 years ago but 47 years from now if i'm no longer on this earth you will never forget this moment you will never forget this moment of humanity of kindness of compassion empathy for our people and for the planet it is our responsibility to take care of our people all over the world you don't need to be a politician to do that you just want to be a kind compassionate empty person to do it like me traveling all the way from kakumaru fujicam because i'm a concerned african teaching young people how to code can improve our economies you are all talking about sustainable development goals in your work every single day but we need to start giving people decent work when i see companies coming to africa using our code is paying them 200 500 it's an insult for our continent because we spend time training these people you go to uganda one of the first tech hub i created in 2012 we have coders sitting down there but we need to pay them decent money we need to pay young people decent money google and facebook are paying people a lot of money so when a young boy and a girl in africa have skills let's pay them decent salaries because when a young woman has got money she helped her communities her mother her father and wealth we know must be equal so i'm trying right now to promote you for employment education and training we have to give young people jobs so one of the thing i want to talk to you about is the the language we use i've been thinking the last couple of days here the language we use when it comes to coding and technology innovation and and digital literacy and you name it i sit at the world economic forum i a very privileged position i have where i look into the taxonomy of education and how do we work with government the private sector to make sure we use the languages we need to make sure we are creating the jobs of tomorrow young girls need creativity they need critical thinking you can see the kakuma girls how smart they are they're refugees but being a refugee is not written on your back like being an abused child like i was it's not written on my back if i didn't share my soy today you wouldn't know because you saw me wandering around with my blue dress and my glasses and my rings and my hair you think i just made it here no i didn't it took me years to heal as a young girl years to be dispassionate this powerful speaker and an excellent person it took years so we can really make sure young girls and boys growing up across all are excellent in what they do excellent in what they do we have the black excellence we start promoting our people i sit at the risk killing platform at the world academic forum where we have a target of one billion people by 2030 this is a very very important data and next week i'll be at davos to beg leaders to really think about how can we do this together data matters i am data today because i was not part of the census of the senegalese i was not part of the senegalese there in 1980s 1990s i didn't have a birth certificate so it's very important we sort out the issues as we go along and talk about taking innovation i go to kakamora fishing because it's a shame for africa it is a shame for africa six hundred thousand people living in a heat in a desert one meal a day one cup of tea in the afternoon as tony said i could i am the food so young girls can eat if you don't have something to eat your brain doesn't work i used to have one meal a day in senegal and now i have plenty of food in my supermarket my son is privileged young mixed-race child sitting in the uk eating takeaways and sugary food because he doesn't know anything about poverty but my young girls in kakuma don't eat they do not eat so if when you don't eat your brain don't work there are girls there's no plan it be is only one single planet so we can pretend that kakuma don't exist or refugees don't exist until tomorrow but it does exist that's why i am a concert african going and helping my people they are the first girls in the world in a refugee camp setting settlement to learn how to code because i know eight years from now ten years from now when we go at the united nation together in 2030 when i'm telling the world i told girls how to code they will be standing sharing their stories i know that for fact i can visualize 20 30 8 years from now i'll be 56 years old so the girls are planting trees they're looking into the climate change issues they've got over 100 trees right now they're planting in their schools i bought them uniforms i don't call myself an african philanthropist it's a bit arrogant but i'm a concerned african who's using her wealth her power her influence to go and educate inform and transform the refugees are refugees today but by the time i finish they'll become kodus and you will hire them because i am building right now one of the africa largest pipeline for coders that is linked to humanity kindness and compassion and this is the right moment now before i finish i've taken too much time i want to now tell you the gift i'm giving to our continent you all have been struggling during covet 19 but if you don't have content you don't have connectivity don't have infrastructure we are wasting time as i said time is critical so the gift i'm giving to our continent today is the 12 weeks blended learning content that has global goals life skills and soft skills and we have launched the imdc digital platform where now you can go and learn how to code you can now go and learn how to code as of today for free you don't pay for anything this is the platform i built it's almost like the coursera for africa you can now go and learn the four coding languages having e-learning platforms don't teach people how to code we must stop funding e-learning platforms that don't have content for coding so this is the e-learning platform this is the digital platform i launched for young girls and boys to learn how to code you can go and download the app and we can talk about this later and everything is focused on the united nations sustainable development goals so i want to finish just by saying thank you minister thank you everyone i'm a very passionate concerned african i'm extremely privileged to be here giving you a keynote but it is absolutely crucial that i leave you with this takeaway you must be a concerned citizen and when you are a concerned citizen you embed this with comp with compassion kindness and empathy you will go and transform the world because in 2030 you and i will meet at the united nations and you will ask me lady mariam have you taught 1 million women and girls how to code my answer will be yes thank you so much thanks wow that was a amazing what a what a terrific start to the morning thank you so much for your work lady miriam i'd now like to invite um and thelma fuaque and thelma you're welcome to speak from there or up here just to let you know and i love it that you're an ardent believer in the future of africa love that that you head the digital infrastructure and capacity building division of the smart africa secretariat a pan-african organization based in kigali rwanda with a membership of 32 countries across africa among other activities of what she does is harmonization of policies and creating strategies in the area of digital infrastructure data protection regulation cyber security capacity building from member countries across africa that's quite a bit of thelma that's amazing so i'd like to now invite tama would you like to join us and give us your comments thank you thank you and uh thank you lady maryam i think that was a really really passionate speech i'm truly inspired and i'm sure everybody here is inspired um honorable minister of ict and innovation in rwanda madam polan gabriel distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen good morning before i go on i'd like to ask the technical team to help me with a video from the director general and chief executive officer of smart africa secretariat he sent his apologies he would have loved to be here and so he has asked for us to play this video so please go ahead thank you honourable minister of ict and innovation of rwanda minister paula ingabiri distinguished guest and participant ladies and gentlemen good morning to you all i'm delighted to speak to you all and would have wished to be with you in persons today but could not due to unavoidable circumstances allow me to congratulate organizers for this e-learning conference and for it being in the 15 editions despite all that happened in the past two to three years due to pandemic of it one of the foremost projects in smart africa is about education and supporting needy students around africa to pursue higher educations in technology and this goes to show how central we see the role of education playing in a digital transformations of africa before i go on i'd like to introduce you to what smart topic is all about smart africa is an alliance of 32 ambitious and progressive african countries international organizations and global private sector player task with advancing africa's digital agenda the alliance is empowered by a bold and innovative commitment by african head of the state to accelerate sustainable social economic development on the continent and to usher africa into the knowledge economy through affordable access to broadband and ict at the heart of our visions to create a single digital market in africa by 2030 lies the need to skill and re-skill the continent present and future workforce the united nations sustainable development goal emphasized this urgency in its education's target for 2030. this gold includes among others full access to high quality schooling from early childhood through secondary equitable access to affordable technical vocational and territory educations and more investment in education facilities to improve learning environment at the moment we have at smart africa about 32 projects ongoing but i will speak and focus more on five of them which are essential to achieving the education goal in the effective and efficient manner number one the ict blueprint for skills developments in capacity building and education a flagship of the republic of burkina faso the blueprints analyzes the current ict in education status of the continents and formulate recommendations to improve the outcome of the ict in schools we are disseminating this blueprint to governments across africa to help is the mainstreamed technology in education number two is this father cadiz academy currently implemented across seven countries sata is as we call it is a dynamic pan-african learning ecosystem in which african citizens at all age can acquire and improve their digital skills acquire qualifications and meet the emerging talents need of employers industry or be rely or be self-reliant till date we have trained close to 2 000 policy and decision makers from across 26 countries in africa and looking to do more number three is the smart africa scholarship program this is the project that has so far sponsored about 82 students across the continent to pursue higher education in technology related fields till date we have been able to raise 1.6 million us dollars and seeking more to support the growth of technology number four the smart africa giga project in collaboration with the itu and unicef global giga project to connect every school in africa to the internet number five it's a smart broadband 2025 strategy a transformative broadband strategy for africa towards accelerating sustainable broadband penetrations in africa the future of africa our prosperity depends on our capacity to innovate and becomes more competitive on the global stage we cannot achieve this unless we are as technically literate as the other competing nations and continent this task our education's ecosystem to develop a great engagement with industry for example through public private partnership and generate the required knowledge and innovations distinguished guests ladies and gentlemen to me the sdg for education challenges africa need a continued and expanded public-private commitments of resources and increase leadership effort to encourage innovations and technology we need to put in place an enabling digital environment overcome the challenges of the traditional system of learning and allow the various impactful way to implement technology in education i thank you once again for giving me this opportunity to present this keynote and allow me to hand it over to my colleague telma to share some of the exciting initiative engaged on the continent wishing you a very productive session thank you thank you thank you thank you for the attention so uh one of the key things that mr lassina koni said was this he said the future of africa our prosperity depends on our capacity to innovate and become more competitive on the global stage we cannot achieve this unless we are as technically literate as the other competing nations and continent and i believe this buttresses what lady miriam also said in terms of being able to incapacitate the youth of africa there was a book that i read recently the bold new normal by a pan african called lucy quest and one of the quotes i picked from that book says and i i quote human potential is evenly distributed around the globe the outcome is determined by what you choose to do with that potential so that means that as much as as africans we are not there yet in terms of our human capital index the potential is there and that's why for me i'm an added believer in the potential of africa and earlier on this week i was i was at a meeting and i mentioned the fact that the resource of africa is not necessarily the gold or the cocoa that we have or the oil it's the human capital we have so much youth we have i mean africa accounts for 60 the youth account for 60 percent of the population in africa and this youth have so much potential and how we handle this youth now will determine our future our progress as africa in the near future i would like to tell you a story of a lady which really buttresses what lady miriam had mentioned earlier on so her name is jemima i met her in 2017 she had just completed the university four years of university dream was actually to become a software developer but life had its own terms and she ended up being a people teacher that's like a basic great teacher and she had to take that up not because she was passionate about it but because she had to make ends meet life was really hard for her mind you this is somebody who had done computer science for four years and was out there looking for a job however that she had never seen a computer before then in 2018 there was the creation of a startup called codefactory it's an institution that trains individuals on competency-based skills when it comes to software development as well as project management and other soft skills so jemima went through code factory for about nine months and after nine months she was able to get an internship in one of the software development companies in ghana and later on after three months or so she was able to get into full-time employment fast forward now she's getting fully employed she's very happy and one of the practical things that you would see when you invest in women is that we pay it forward so she started also paying it forward to her society training girls in basic coding teaching them how to be empowered for instance well but girl empowerment is not why i'm here today it's about the stillness of our education i'm sure a lot of us here know too many jemimas where they go to school they go to university they come out and they cannot find any job to do after four years of education she came out and there was no relevant skills i know there's no simple solution to it we've been talking about it and i like the the emphasis again for my co-panelists on time there's no time anymore and so we need to take action as stakeholders in this room i believe the stakeholders in this room have the power to create a better life for the genomics of this world and as much as there is no simple solution before i sit allow me to pinpoint about four things that i think we can do the first thing would be the political will if there's no political will we are not going anywhere so for instance there is there there are some countries that allocate some percentage of their budget to education but we've seen that the traditional way of educating educating is not giving us good quality unesco says that about 80 percent of our youth are now in education which is great progress however the human capital index in africa is quite low why is because of the quality i'll tell you again the story of ghana where the the government had invested on a platform an e-learning platform called icampus way before covered and the usage was quite low and just before covet the government was just about abandoning it and then covered hit and then eye campus became very very useful so that's a clear example of um political will and leadership as policy makers we need to make sure we are prepared ahead of time we don't need to wait for pandemics we don't need to wait for the the events that we we we don't plan for before we plan i mean before we act sorry and then our curriculum you know i don't think it's so easy to decide that we are going to put a specific technology in our curriculum as we know curriculum changes very very fast so you may be teaching even a certain language today or a certain technology today which may not be useful in five years time and so what i would propose is can we now adapt a human-centered approach in our curriculum things that make our youth self-learners life-long learners they are able to learn and learn reskill themselves for the future for instance then also the approach to learning the third one is the approach to learning do we need to to rethink our pedagogy for instance should we still be instructional or collaborative and even when we pivot to e-learning there's also the opp
rtunity of students having an array of teachers they can choose from because if i'm if i want to learn data science for instance i can log in online and choose which teacher i want to i want to learn from based on the style of teaching so we need to rethink even the style of of an approach to learning and teaching as well and then finally um out close to our out close with saying that we need also to involve the private sector and the industry in creating content if we don't in involve the private sector the industry we will have a lot of the jemimas i met in 2017 however if we want the jemima of 2022 we need to be able to close to work closely with the likes of the google the amazon um the local industry to to ask them what are the skills that you need and this approach has been um tested and has been shown successful in in singapore where for instance they try to curate content for the next 20 years not specifically on the technologies but on the approach that students are able to absorb learn and learn and reskill themselves so i held close with this brief comment and say that there is definitely a way forward we need to be able to create more gmail ms of 2022 and we look forward to a lot more of what lady jemima is doing and when i said during the panel discussion i'm going to be sharing more on what we are doing also at smart africa to address this problem thank you very much for your attention [Applause] thelma that was terrific and we're so glad that your director was able to join us as well so compliments to the terrific work of your organization our next speaker is momo bertrand and momo again great storyteller love that learning innovation team of the united nations international training center where you are a training and communication specialist with extensive experience in the united states europe and africa currently works at the international training center of the ilo ilo united nations agency based in turin italy moma be terrific to hear your your comments as well and having noted earlier that the gender imbalance on the panel as well and looking around this room and seeing how many motivated and passionate and powerful young women there are that are helping us move this continent forward so momo please represent our gender how can inclusive technology transform education in africa how can the wave of e-learning revolutions you know open the doors of education to every child and every learner on this continent you see today if you take 100 children randomly in most african countries children aged about 10 and you write what i just said 70 will not be able to understand learning poverty is a huge obstacle today on our continent and and we know that this is a problem because this is me and my mom i don't know i think i was 11 or 12 there and and i know that education opens doors because it has done this for me my grandma didn't go to school my mom had little education but she invested so much in my education and and thanks to this investment i was able to go to school in cameroon have a u.s experience and now work with the u.n at the itci ilo in torino and my goal and my dream is really that every child on the continent should have the same opportunities that i had but how do we make this possible here are five concrete ideas to accelerate access to education and also outcomes of education on the continent the first is africa is not a country africa is not a country africa is a diverse and rich continent with so much so much nuances and so it's not enough to translate an app from english to swahili and think it's going to automatically work in kenya it's not enough to change the icons of your app and give them a black skin and automatically it's going to work in cameroon it is in critical to understand the nuances in every country in every country on the continent and even more importantly we have to co-design and adapt education solutions to every community and i'm not just talking about solutions that may come from the west to to africa i'm also talking about traditions that can travel from one african country to another so this is critical africa is not a a africa is not a country it's a continent number two we have to invest in women-led solutions and promote equality in the field of e-learning if you look at the data women young women are 10 percent less likely to own a mobile phone in sub-saharan africa and this is from 2018 maybe the data has changed but let's realize that as we transition to the field of e-learning the biases the gaps don't go away actually technology if we are not careful can actually amplify these gaps that exist so we really need to be careful and it's not just about you know getting girls into the classroom it's also making sure that girls have a seat at the table women have a seat at the table when decisions linked to e-learning are being made i'm thinking about amazing entrepreneurs like you know lady mariam or ariel kitio a cameroonian phd who launched an initiative to break girls tech phobia and she has helped hundreds of girls to get into tech through e-learning so we can we need to invest in the aerial kits in every country on the continent and i think it is hypocritical to claim that we are pushing for girls inclusion without ensuring that women actually have a seat at the table when decisions are being made so we need to change this and i love our panel because we have amazing women and i love actually the balance you know we have to fix things it has been the other way around for too long so i think this is amazing and the third thing is we need to avoid the sns syndrome does anybody know what sns syndrome is anybody you want to guess nobody okay it's the single negative story syndrome and i was talking to some people on a flight here you know um from torino to to kigali and i was like i'm going to this education conference and it's like oh education in africa they don't have internet they don't have computers they don't they don't they dude we can't just focus on what is not good going well in africa let's also think about what is going well in africa there's actually this quote of obama that i love and that we can twist there's nothing wrong in the education system of africa that can't be fixed with what is right in the education system in africa so it's time to change the narrative and this is critical and and this means looking at what africa already has today 495 million people have mobile phone subscriptions go back 20 years and this is a radical you know transformation today as i'm speaking we have 400 000 kilometers of under utilized fiber networks and this is mostly owned by governments and we can we can envision a scenario where we liberalize the telecom industry and we enable private sector partners to use to share this infrastructure this can lower the cost of data and bring a lot of opportunities for e-learning so we have some assets and we have thousands of education innovators the telmas the minister you know the lady mariams and all amazing innovators here who are already making a difference let us not get like we i am tired of hearing okay this is not working what is working and how can we amplify that that is critical you know we actually tonight i'm leaving the conference and going to south africa where the fifth global conference on the elimination of child labour is happening and we had a little issue you know child labor is a very heavy topic but how can we speak about hope when we're talking about child labor and we had a simple idea come up with come up with a social media challenge where people have to do three things draw a smiley face on their hands take a selfie and post it on social media saying i raised my hand for a world free of child labor and add the hashtag raise your hand for kids and that three people in a matter of a week we had like four thousand people joining the challenge and since i still have about five minutes i want to invite you to take the challenge now if you have a pen if you draw if you can draw a smiley on your hand take a selfie post it on social media right now we give you like 60 seconds and say i raised my hand for a word free of charge label add the hashtag and tag triple three people so go draw a smiley okay thank you i see some people are already doing it and this is important because we know that 160 million children are in charge level and so it is critical that we take action draw the smiley take the selfie do the posting with a hashtag raise your hand for kids dark people touch three people and say i raise my hand for a while free of child level and you can do it with your part with the person who is sitting next to you just make sure you use the hashtag raise your hand for kids 20 seconds again 20 seconds thanks to everybody who's taking part in joining this movement for the rights of children this is very important ten seconds nine eight seven sis okay thank you you can also do the challenge after but thank you so much for joining the movement so it's it's always about changing the narrative thank you for raising your hand for kids the fourth point is to put humans before technology and i think the human-centered approach has already been mentioned here but at the international training center of the ilo where i work one of our mantras is we want to design learning in the innovation interventions that are human-centered so i think um on the first day a teacher from kenya mentioned something very important you know sometimes we want teachers to adapt to e-learning you know methodologies but we don't consider them as partners we are like hey you start using zoom you don't consult the teachers and i think it we have to move away from this you know autocratic system and consider really teachers as partners in the digital transformation that needs to happen in schools also the parents you know i think it's funny that we as educators are trying to change the lives of students but we forget to involve probably the most important person in the life of a kid the parents in cameroon for example the the president of the parents teachers association is usually the second most important person in the school after the principle so how can your interventions consider the role of parents and still being human human-centered not only parents but the learners themselves and all the players that are around the learner let's put humans before technology this is critical and my final point is that inclusive learning is not just about access so you know sometimes when you're talking about education we're like my platform has one million users yes that's access you've given access to one million people but what are the outcomes 10 years down the line what do they have you know decent jobs are they giving back to the community and so i think there's a lot of opportunity especially in the field of innovation in education to explore also longitudinal studies to see the impact because there's a lot of bursts you know hey the kids are going to go into this virtual reality room it's going to be so cool selfies and everything but is it creating jobs big question you can say okay we are going to train a visually impaired student but then ultimately down the line are they able to get jobs do you provide some support this is really critical you know at the itcl we recently published the digital inclusion and adult learning guide you can take a picture and download it later but but let me just leave if you want to take a picture of this um but one of the key things that we argue for it's it's not just about access give access provide quality education but also think about outcomes we were having coffee with delmar and and i think anthony asked what is wonderful learning for you and some of us were like oh it should be entertaining and everything and tell myself something that really touched me wonderful learning is about being able to create decent jobs down the line and in an african context where decent jobs are so much needed i think this is critical so not just access but also recognition and employability are critical so and and one key thing that i think we should really remember and and i'm finishing now is when you do reporting on the impact of your e-learning interventions please disagree get data not only on access but also outcomes because sometimes we see that okay we have trained you know 1 000 people we had gender equality 500 boys but and 500 girls but the boys get jobs but then the women or the girls still have face difficulties so disaggregate the data when you report this can help you also identify you know bottlenecks and adjust your interventions accordingly i just want to close with two of my my favorite quotes the first is that education is the most powerful weapon that we can use to change the world and this is from nelson mandela and the second is it's beautiful i think it says if you want to think in terms of one year plant a seed if you want to think in terms of 10 years plant a tree but if you want to think in terms of 100 years teach the future generations and my hope is that 100 years from now our children's children would meet in kigali rwanda and they will say we are celebrating 50 years of full quality education across the continent and across the world and i think it starts with each and every one of us let's make universal education quality education on the continent a reality for all let's raise our hand for every child thank you momo that was great and i can't imagine that individual on the plane that you had the conversation with wasn't absolutely convinced that he had the wrong idea by the time the plane landed so we just have to send momo around the world in planes with your passion and your articulateness for and terrific slides which i hope will be able to make available as well to the presenters a terrific job um i now would like to invite the honorable minister paula ingeberry ict and innovation to provide some comments from where you're sitting uh minister as well and maybe just to give a little of your background you served as the head of the ict business development department of the rwanda development board and coordinator of the kagali innovation city project you also worked as the smart africa coordinator an initiative that seeks to leverage broadband infrastructure to drive africa's social economic growth she's a graduate of mit's school of engineering and sloan school of management in system design and management and holds a bs in computer engineering and information technology from the former kagali institute of science and technology we're delighted that you could join us and take some extra time to be with us today and look forward to your comments thank you minister thank you very much i think as as i sitted here for the last one hour i've been trying to think how do i disrupt the flow of going to the front since this is meant to be a part of composition but i thought what a better place to bring that disruption because as we talk about e-learning surely we're also thinking about disrupting education system as it is today so it's truly an honor and pleasure to be with you this morning to share and learn from the different speakers that have you know shared the very interesting work that you're all doing and as quite amazed uh at the impact uh that each one of you um is working on but just as we think through and i see right there um what we have is really the session which is around how do we spread the benefit of education to everyone and more than ever uh thinking about the times that we live in uh post uh covered 19 or during covet i think the one thing that we learned is that hybrid learning is probably here to stay and i know this is this is not new for everyone especially for all of you that are here in the room today but i think everyone whether you're an educator a teacher a policy maker in the private sector in the civil society and at the core of your work is you know improving education and learning outcomes improving access to education affordability of quality education i know in your various you know responsibilities each one of you has always thought about what is going to be the role of technology in delivering quality education in delivering equal access to education and i know there was a strong emphasis on this panel as we talked about having um you know young girls uh you know having equal access to the different education opportunities and so um with that i think even as we think about leaving no one behind from a broadband infrastructure perspective we can't afford um to leave anyone behind when it comes to access to education and i think technology digital technologies digital solutions provide that opportunity but it's not obvious it's not obvious because i think for many of us if we can relate to the various countries where we come from a lot of effort has been put in putting in place the necessary broadband infrastructure whether it's connecting schools whether it's connecting homes whether it's connecting uh communities and but what you see is that there's still a big gap when it comes to usage when it comes to how do we leverage and benefit from uh this infrastructure that uh has been put in place and and um the story is not different uh even for rwanda just to give you a bit of statistics we have over 95 percent population coverage when it comes to 3g over 97 percent for 4g and this is population coverage not geographic coverage but when you look at the usage statistics uh it's staggering it's glaring you have about 29 percent so you have so many people that live in areas of coverage yet they're still not benefiting from that and i think that's why the conversation that we're having today listening to lady mariam listening to momo and telma as everyone emphasizes you know digital literacy digital skilling access to education this is really where the much needed focus on investments need to be made as we try to close on on that usage gap as i was looking up some statistics looking uh there's a report that ifc issued where you have over and what it says is in the next decade over 57 million jobs in the world will require digital skills and when we talk about digital skills uh we're really talking about digi basic digital literacy skills uh momod and lady maryam uh we're talking about coding but we're also talking about how many of our children how many of our teachers how many of our own people in our communities are able to use a device to access the information to access the opportunities whether it's a job to access all these education opportunities that we have i think all of us can relate with when we all first heard of covet cases in our various countries and most of the schools were struggling to ensure that they minimized the disruption that was happening around the school closures so for private schools it was a different story if they had the infrastructure the kids that are going to those schools can afford to be connected to the internet can afford to go and zoom and still engage with their teacher but the story was different uh when you're talking about public schools and so for some countries well they could not afford some of these tools the the best option uh that could that they could revert to in the absence of broadband connectivity of devices of skills was learning through radio and tv and what that means is that the the learning outcomes the landing gap that we've seen has probably doubled or tripled because if you have a student think about it your own child who is going to learn through radio imagine how much is lost in that process and and so i think even putting on my policy-making heart um for us it's been more more than ever very evident that infrastructure is not enough it's the scaling but also what has been important is to understand that the heart of all of this is the teacher i'll share with you an example about 15 years ago we started the one laptop a child initiative here in rwanda and we were you know giving primary school kids laptops to use but the challenge for us immediately was evident because even the teachers who spent most of their time with their students did not know how to use this device so there was really a huge gap in even ensuring that this device was being used maximumly and so that's why for us we've pivoted to a focus where we're looking at really empowering the teacher first building their digital literacy skills ensuring that they have the best you can bare minimum digital literacy skills to use a device to deliver um you know the the the their lessons in the classroom to prepare ahead of time um and and when we talk about it it may seem uh is this a nice to have thing it's not a nice to have thing because if a teacher has had the time to prepare their material and when they're in the classroom they're not so much focused on rewrite copying notes from a notebook and putting it on the blackboard for the students to copy them back but rather they are focused on ensuring that whether it's a class of 60 students or 30 students or 90 students that they are grasping the concepts because they've prepared that they've projected it and they're just trying to ensure that the classroom engagement is happening so this is where we've shifted and we there are many partners we have itu and unicef that are championing a global initiative called giga i'm sure most of you have already heard of it it's really around school connectivity and not just looking at infrastructure it's looking at digitizing the curriculum digitizing the learning material empowering teachers with the right skills and the right tools and ensuring that when they deliver their classes it's an engaging um and an engaging collaboration with the students um about three weeks ago because we've we are one of the um uh the the the lighthouse countries for giga so we've uh piloted the giga initiative in one in about 63 schools here in rwanda so about three weeks ago we visited some of these schools and and and this is the power of knowing that you shouldn't wait to get it all perfect to start rolling out this program just almost figuring out what do i have at hand let me deploy and i'll learn along the way and we'll figure out how to uh perfect the impact and the outcomes that you were talking about momo that we would all be looking for and what became very obvious because we were shifting from should we have two smart classrooms per school and what does that mean it's having two classrooms that are equipped with the computers internet connectivity and you're guaranteeing that for every student within a week at least they will interact with this infrastructure at least four to five hours a week and so we're pivoting from that and saying if we're putting the teacher at the center of this um using the holy days using the school closures that happened during covet 19 to teach them to give them basic digital literacy skills digitizing the curriculum as much as we can helping them to prepare material using the devices that they've been provided what more do we need to do and so as we as we visited these schools and looked at how it has been exciting how the teachers were feeling excited that they were they've been empowered and right now they can focus more on the classroom experience then we realized maybe we shouldn't even just be thinking about broadband infrastructure laptops digital literacy what other devices do they need should we have a projector we also have a blackboard what is the interface of some of these things and so i'm sharing this story just to share with you what our journey has been as we um you know we thought about how do we integrate digital technologies to improve learning outcomes to improve the teaching experience to improve the learning experience and this is just at the classroom level we still have a lot of work to do because now when students go back home then what um and and that's the journey that all of us are taking as you know as a country as as countries that are represented here to say that yes once you get it right for the classroom experience and students do get home how are we thinking about last mile connectivity is it affordable uh do do households that are living below the poverty line what what unique and innovative and affordable solutions do we put out at their disposal what learning centers do we put in the communities for families that still will not be able to afford this so that at least within a community there's a space uh that students can actually go to and still be able uh to learn and i think one thing we can all agree with in this room is that a lot of learning will also happen outside the classroom we don't always and and just yesterday actually i was meeting about three young um you know quarters they're really self-taught and i like the platform that you're developing lady mariam and really going to have to mobilize our own people to benefit from it and i was impressed to see that a lot of what they've done over the last three years is self-teaching it's having access to platforms like the one lady mariam is launching and making sure on a daily basis they're learning a new skill they're testing it it's hands-on they're trying it here and there and today they're great developers they're people that you can employ and most of them are even not even halfway through their university degrees and so it is our responsibility and really to echo what everyone else was saying here on the panel as i close off with my remarks it's our responsibility to do that last mile extension of education beyond the classroom because as we think about disrupting it's not just disrupting the current education system it's really providing this extension that is so much needed to encourage self-learning thank you very much thank you honourable minister and again what a beautiful partnership with your passion and insight into education working with your colleagues in other ministries as a model of demonstration to avoid silos but have ministries working with each other so clearly your passion and education and keeping the teacher at the center and the child as opposed to the technology i'm sure resonates with those of us who have been working in this field for such a long time well we've come to the end of it we want to turn the opportunities we're going to conclude the formal sessions so you have a few minutes to have particular questions with the panelists before they leave but i want to say as the chair of this panel it's every panel chair dream to simply have an amazing panel of captivating and compelling speakers so i'm not going to be embarrassed to say this to the other chair people who are in here i have the best panel and maybe a round of applause and please uh join us up here to ask questions of our panelists and thank you panelists again for your contributions [Applause] so you
do you want a better Lifestyle the freedom to do what you want and never worry about money again well I'm gonna share a little secret with you I wanted that too I spent months learning buying products and trying tactics and struggling to get any results I racked up over fifty one hundred dollars in debt and I put in countless hours getting up early and staying up late while working a job and raising a family I tried a lot of stuff but only one thing ever worked and what I discovered is the only Dependable proven way to build a six or seven figure digital business is to create and sell digital products in fact it's the only way I've seen work for me people I've helped and countless others it worked 15 years ago it works now and it'll work forever because it's based on the real business principle of creating value for others and getting paid for that you'll help people solve their problems and in exchange you make money it's not based on Trends fads glitches or loopholes it's not based on perfect timing or luck it's still one true digital business that can change your life it took me from overworked at a thankless job and stressed out of my mind scraping together monthly bills and mortgage payments to living how I want with no boss no schedule no office employees or overhead and feeling in total control of my finances and life and if I can do it you can do it because it's not me it's the system I'm using I use the system and it works for me you use the system and it'll work for you in fact I don't want to reveal the guru's Dirty Little Secret but spoiler alert the gurus who pitch you products that promise Miracle results actually make their money using the same system creating and selling digital products to you and not from their own products claimed results the system is Just Three Steps step number one create a digital product making products can take weeks or months to do it yourself or cost thousands of dollars to Outsource between research creating content layout and production I'm going to show you how to skip all that and create an unlimited supply of unique high demand digital products in minutes without any research or product development step number two set up a sales website creating websites can take weeks or run you thousands of dollars to Outsource between writing copy adding graphics and doing layouts forget all that because I'm going to show you how to create awesome High converting websites in minutes with zero Tech skills that can sell anything step number three generate traffic to make sales getting traffic can be confusing take forever drain your wallets or to all three I'm Gonna Save you all of those headaches and show you how to get an unlimited supply of hungry buyers without spending a dime on traffic do those three steps and you've got a proven scalable profitable business you'll be proud of because you're helping people solve their problems and getting paid for it I've literally made Millions with it and you have the same opportunity but figuring it all out on your own can be hard it took me six full months to make my first tiny 17 sale like that's improving optimizing and refining it and now I'm going to share the exact same system with you so you get a quick shortcut to the top introducing run your own done for you e-learning Empire without any team skills experience or capital and without quitting your day job it's a complete proven digital Business System including but it creates digital products set up websites and get traffic to make sales so you can start making sales as fast as your first day because you can cancel and replace any video creation software website software graphic designers video producers or webmasters because you no longer need them for this so even at 997 dollars it wouldn't actually cost you anything but when you act now you'll get the complete system with you can keep whatever income you have now and add this to it having that kind of Financial Security is a great feeling click the button now to get started

 many South Africans live in poor crowded townships or rural areas high unemployment and the legacy of inequality mean that most young people attend underresourced schools often students perform poorly and not many schools have a library the country faces a major challenge to boost literacy rates in the over 15s with few describing themselves as active readers the funds of literacy trust has created an Innovative way to change that one of the major reasons why there isn't uh reading culture in South Africa is because books are incredibly expensive and outside the realm of the vast majority of people um what we really are trying to do is to increase that access but also it's not just to any book the fact is that we need locally generated content which is going to excite young people and make them see that their lives are relevant that their stories are relevant and that they can see reflected in the books and the stories that they read from back in the good in the good old days when all was well back when T often smiled that golden smile of funza uses the power of mobile technology to connect and interact with readers over 50,000 young South Africans access the site each month through smartphones computers and the mixit app readers can also discuss books or leave comments at the end of chapters she have she have hears some news I my friends and I we read together all the time on our cell phones on the computer we always together when we reading every Fridays we sit together and read a book together the big part of our philosophy is also making sure that um readers can share our content with their friends so both on the responsive site and on the mixit app we've got sharing mechanisms and we really are trying to encourage our readers to grow those communities further funza staff know that reading can enhance critical thinking skills encourage personal development and and influence life choices this is our M site every week we've got a new short story I love story very ni funza is also building a community of authors who provide content in a range of South African languages they nurture Young Writers through a mentoring program and authors are given the opportunity to strengthen their storytelling  skills yeah you find that when you see the the progress that they've made when you read how their writing has improved and you know that you are part of that growth it's um it's the most amazing thing sometimes you forget that you have a talent or you have something but then funza just brings out that the best in me and it kind of like shows me that I have a purpose in life through mobile technology thousands of young people across South Africa have become active readers while many young people still have limited access to books the funza literary trust is bringing the library to them

the covet 19 pandemic made online learning and virtual classrooms become increasingly popular proving to many educational institutions parents and even students how much technology can enhance the learning process although edtech that is education technology is nothing new the concept has far become a buzzword as various schools and educators latch onto e-learning platforms to help students have a more comprehensive learning process despite technological challenges faced different ideas and digital platforms have popped up to help bridge the education gap and are changing the narrative in the ed tech space we discuss with rebecca stromaya founder of e-learning africa to see how we can leverage e-learning to strengthen our education processes hello rebecca glad to have you on the show today thank you very much for having me i pronounce your name right yeah you got it right okay um how important is e-learning uh in today's world well i think in today's world post pandemic or during the pandemic uh e-learning has become extremely important in order to have access to education that you can't do if schools are closed if universities are closed um if workplaces so it has it has become hugely relevant globally not just for africa because people are not i have to continue dedication and then the only way to do it is um through some form of remote learning even if it's tv or radio or other methods you've been there from the early days of e-learning you know and up to the pre and the post and drink pandemic and the post how are africans accepting the reality of e-learning i think now now everybody's i mean before that people were excited about it but of course you've got to remember one thing is it's all down to access to the internet so if you don't have you know an infrastructure and if you don't have access to the internet and if you don't have access to quality internet and if you don't have access to affordable internet then you can think it's all wonderful but you're going to have a problem so but so if that's there and then and of course underlying all that is access to power so but if that's there i think that it has it has huge opportunities uh because not just from the perspective of that you have access to to um to the information that you need you have access to quality teachers teachers can teach in a different way they're all these interesting and fun tools that also will appeal to young people the way they think and they change because you know they're far more accustomed to an individual environment um and also just in time learning so from that perspective there are very many advantages it doesn't i would never say that it replaces a great teacher in a great classroom who loves students who feel their students but it has so many advantages and i just think let's say from us to people i'm always doing e-learning just by googling i'm you know doing something i'm reading something i google something that's e-learning i google it in the time when i need it and i retain that information because i do it contextually so i'm not just doing in advance i'm in this situation i put in this one some information i google it i find it i retain that information because it's done within that context that i need it that's the simplest form of e-learning i'd like to expand a bit of on the challenges i mean what are some of the challenges that you think would affect the adoption of e-learning well the first ones i mentioned just now uh other is infrastructure so when the pandemic started last year we did a survey last year when the pandemic started uh serving all pan-african community asking them questions about how they can continue education if schools are closed and many of them receive the mandate from government well now you have to teach online but without telling them how without ensuring there's the access that they need so the underlying challenge is infrastructure as access to to the internet access to power then comes access to devices um and then and of course with that also comes enabling the people that are that are involved enabling and training the teachers but not just and so you couldn't let's say the teachers and they empower the teachers that they know what they're doing but if then the school head or that school administrator doesn't think it's important and doesn't really give them the the environment they need it's not going to work so lots of factors that play a role but of course the basic factor is actually i mean if it's e it's access to the internet you don't have that and of course the cost associated with that so of course it's you know it's not i mean the internet is more expensive in many african countries than it is in europe and so these are kind of things that are i really need to be taken on by government and um and change not only for e-learning but for e-working and we've also seen the pandemic has changed the way we work where we do everything so i think access to affordable quality access to the internet access to power are really important so so that brings us to the question of investment do you think that you know adequate investment is going towards this sector not really no i think um no it isn't um and when you say the e-learning sector i mean in some cases yes you've got some great partnerships so a lot of these a lot of good good initiatives and their many good initiatives are through a public private partnership so you might have a partnership with a foundation together with the government with a donor country that invests but it won't be it'll be maybe for one situation it won't be for the whole country it won't be for all the schools all the universities in the country but but you know at the same time you know things are happening universities are changing universities are finding their own means of doing it they're becoming they're you know they they also need that they need to cr to turn out graduates that are that are relevant for the workplace that will find jobs so they'll they're also looking at ways of becoming more competitive and finding the funds etc but of course i think governments could do more uh and and one of those things is is you know working with the telecommunications corporations to ensure that um it's available how do you see the way that francophone africa and is adopting e-learning in comparison to andrew anglophone africa is there any major difference that you have seen it's slower than anglophone africa it's slow and i think that's mainly due to partnerships um a lot you know a lot of a lot of universities and especially where does e-learning start schools yes but the schools don't necessarily have the funding schools are then regulated a lot by the government and so some schools private schools don't have an issue there's semi-private schools and of course there's a lot of partnership for example with different foundations and donor countries to support schools but if this if the if it's people driving e-learning's often universal they're driving electrical down to other areas and uh and so i it's the angle the anglophone-speaking universities that have had more partnerships with countries like the uk the us etc but it's catching up um it's also because france was quite slow to to adopt online learning uh awesome so my final question will be around i mean for example i believe that you know the future of africa is you know the the number of you know young people who are able to educate you know but i know that the physical classroom wouldn't be able to achieve that right so what do you think is a future of e-learning uh for education in africa okay so as a as a result the good i mean pandemic bought a lot of bad stuff but it also brought a lot of good stuff but what abroad is the fact that we have meetings like this we you know we everybody's adopted zoom and things there's no problem so as a result i've done all these virtual events as well so normally it's the annual one-year event eight year face-to-face plus different reports but now we've done a host of virtual events a host of webinars um which have allowed people from all over the world and to participate within academies and as a result of that people have seen that online isn't so bad so in the past for example the perception i think of employers and perception of governments and not just in africa and the perception of parents was that an online degree was not the same as a university degree whether a student was present but now with a shift that everybody's actually had to trial an error people who actually went to university in a formal university had to then switch to online and so they had had advantages they could have done just as well sure there's certain things missing you're not out there with young people but the shift of perception has happened as a result of the pandemic that online education will be seen as more um acceptable and that's and that and so there are some initiatives for example by some universities abroad if you want to study abroad they say look the first year you can learn online and then the second year will arrange the reasons and you can go and then you can already have this kind of trial and test to see whether you like university another movement of course is also it's not just degrees i mean at the end of the day what is it about an education yes that's a wonderful luxury i'm going to study something because i want to enjoy that you know to stretch my mind i want to learn something new and i have the luxury that i can just study this without it meaning that i have to find a job in this area but that's that's that's not a reality for most people most people it's studying to get a degree to get a job and then if you look at all the people who actually have degrees do they actually find the jobs they often don't find the job because the employers don't think that they have the skills that they need in order to fit into that job or they're not so and then so there's new movement about short degrees stackable credentials and they're various players out there for example sarah i don't know if you've come across them but they have a my open online courses which you can look i can learn anything on there i can do a law degree on there but i can also do a degree on on on on digital marketing a short a short course and so this is going to become more of a reality but it's a question again is how do governments perceive it and how do employers perceive it if they see that these courses are equally as valuable as actually doing a four-year degree in university where i might have done all my papers but not learned the soft skills then that's the movement then you'll be moving forward in that direction but i mean this could be a topic on its own but before now this world doesn't contain thank you very much

ladies and gentlemen it's a great honor to be here with you today um the first thing I'm obligated to show you this slide it's it's really all about Microsoft and education and I think the key things to pick from this is that Microsoft will be involved in education from really 1985. there's over 500 people in the education division in Microsoft globally I think that's the highest number of any companies invested from I.T the suggested to education we invest about nine billion dollars a year in research and development I think there's only one other company that invests more globally in the research engine armor and we have many many different programs that we operate in education many countries here represented benefit in our partners in learning program and the results of that as we train we think something these numbers might be outdated with over 20 million teachers have been trying teaching over 200 million students we have various programs to help University students and there were young developers to learn code and generally we have a broad skills program on how you use our technology to try to control excuses become more employable so let's talk a little bit about Microsoft in education Microsoft in Africa we launched recently something called Microsoft for Africa and it's really got four key themes the first one is that we want to bring millions of affordable devices into Africa and for um not just students but anybody all parts of the community to use that's one key thing we're doing what you can see on the slide there is the the Windows phone which has specifically been designed for Africa at low cost and these things were important in education by the way because we're currently working on an application for a programming called Learning for Life which will enable the mobile phone to read sorry Literacy By The Artist which will enable the refer to read the text to people and it will actually highlight the words as they're being said from the file so a useful little things here that you can do with this kind of Technology we want them around over one million small businesses online in Africa and actually trained 200 000 Africans for skills for employability to technical skills how to use technology and also we have something called use file which is really very important not just here Africa but globally because currently there are so many people that have left school all universities that haven't found jobs the unemployed youth is one of the key Focus areas for us in the company right now now one example of the world you're doing Microsoft parameter which I think is very relevant for this discussion today is something we call TV white spaces Now TV TV white Space is really the gap between the frequencies that we currently have on our TV channels and it was designed that way originally to make sure there was no interference between the TV channels but as it happens as technology has moved on that white space those frequencies we can actually use for Broadband Wi-Fi and communities so we've been working on some projects in Kenya and I've also said Tasmania and that will actually enable us to drive by Broadband Wi-Fi into remote Villages purely by using the frequencies that typically TV channels would use Namibia I think it'd be a very exciting project and we can talk about that later but I think it's overall it's an example of how through Microsoft research is actually started building this technology we can bring benefits really throughout all of Africa now our audition in education for Microsoft is anytime anywhere learning for all and what we mean by that is that we see a time and everyone will learn with technology not only people in Africa but also children with um difficult difficulties such as dyslexia or have compared Vision all of these things we believe all of these students should be able to learn the technology everybody in the world and that's our vision that drives us all the time and that's what how we start to build our programs and Technology Investments we're making to see how we can actually realize that vision so learning very much over the years has changed but interestingly stores are the most I haven't changed very much now here is a picture of different classrooms in fact this really hasn't changed since the 19th century if you still have a classroom with desks the teacher at the front teaching the students we really haven't found any technology even in the industrial revolution in the UK and up until now how are you driving the massive change the way which we teach children so really education is really really will be about is unlocking that achievement and the question is are we solving for the right question the right problems the current learning Paradigm is that you have static previous owner curriculum I think this is common to everywhere in the world you also have a limited personalization so in other words every student in the class has to go at the place of the teacher in the class students have struggled over the extra time and the gifting students aren't driven hard there is limited to that learning Mobility you go to a school and you learn in school and you have very much stack of content you have you know physical books um it's not very um it's not very Dynamic content motivational features for students today and the units of success typically is did the student attend his school right there that's typical the universal measurement and what I want to do here in a second is show you a video of the real future that is put together in our lives of Microsoft show what technology would look like it would be sometime before this land in Africa but knowing what's going to happen I think that helps us plan ahead so we've been on the video I'll speak a little bit about more about this foreign foreign foreign looking through a screen but in fact they were actually looking at a screen from different countries through each other so in other words imagine a classroom where the whole wall is a computer screen and in fact when they went back to the screen they can interact with students in another school in the country in whole of Africa anywhere in the world on the other side but in some cases also translated in language so this technology really exists today in many cases it can be done but it's expensive the other problem we have is that when you look at the screens typically for those of you doing Skype you have a camera on your computer it's a very static camera what we have to try to do is put cameras at every single Pixel of the screen so as I'm looking at the screen I'm moving along then I'm looking directly at the person in front of me I'm not having to look up to a camera above the screen so this technology is being worked on now So within the next 10 minutes or 20 years we will start to see very very large screens with cameras and every single Pixel in the screen so you can start to do some of this this will be absolutely transformational for Education if you're in my opinion why is it important because we know it's expensive you can't do it in South Africa today the design of schools because if you design schools you have to start allowing for the fact that the walls actually need to be replaced by huge screws and you can have screens in every part of the classroom and the teachers can actually spot represent yeah that could be the screen so they can start putting up work that was done last week bringing it back when the class comes in or they can use it in the same way you saw it on the video in terms of screen for students can interact with other students around the world so that really will be transformation the other thing you saw in there is on the new devices you can see that when the child was actually representing it she was actually projecting onto hard surfaces so what you'll be able to do with technology in the future is you'll be able to project onto our services in that hard circus whether it be a table orb or become interactive by using a specific pen so there's some fantastic things that we do in education now I'll let you read this quote I really believe in this quote I can tell you so what's happened we are now in the new era of digital learning we really are at a Tipping Point for an educational Revolution where technology now has become affordable enough where Broadband connectivity can be delivered and where you have a next generation of teachers to really have a fantastic change you have cloud computing so schools no longer have to manage all the infrastructure for email hosting inside the school you can manage it in the cloud all of the Publishers are providing all their content digitally are they moving very aggressively and you have learning Mobility with mobile devices and governments around the world are looking at understanding that human capital is the best investment they can make and so they need to make sure the Next Generation Workforce traveling with these key skills these 21st century skills with employers are looking for so we are now at the Tipping Point for massive change and massive change means not just changing the technology and how it can be used but also the curriculum everything needs to change the design of schools everything the key drivers of technology changed in the classroom are really learning beyond the classroom Mobility personalization so that individual students who actually then have their own personal lessons and plans to be built around them that they can actually use the technology New Concept Dynamics interactive content getting points automatically for achieving something and actually cutting up a badge process in developing 21st century skills which are critical but I'll come on to that okay I was in Namibia back in 2005 we were working on something called the African Pathfinder you pick Namibia because it was small enough for us to manage it only had about 12 schools but they're actually on the map there and we've learned an awful lot from that in fact this thing here I call the 10 critical components of successful educational ICT strategy we built it because of the learnings we had here in Namibia and now I use this now in every governing engagement I make because what it is is we say you have to do all these 10 things so I haven't got time to go through with you down but if you speak to anyone from Microsoft they can explain this to you but if some of these things aren't available it's not just about giving these devices to students and saying off you go below the technology you have to have a plan originally was here we had nine with only one which is really the environmental impact of Technologies because all the governments are over talking to us about it we knew if the company was becoming important especially disposal of old technology and how you manage it and how you manage energy it's very important so I'd like to talk to you about the Windows tablet very briefly I only have three here if we believe these are critical um tablets now for Education because the fact that they have longer battery life they have um there's much that they're much lighter to use this is this is one from another Lisa and you can see it's a device here has a keyboard but I've actually just removed the screen I can just walk around using this tablet and support so I don't actually use this in the classroom and this has 11 hours battery life so it's a pretty useful device there's another one here um from JP sakuto we're actually the execution here this is great this is a millennium device it's a convertible so what you can do with a screen you can turn it around you can shut the screen up you take out the pen and it comes your tablets and students can use inside the class also have a cable this is a Microsoft Surface device it's a little flip screen so you can hold it up like that the keyboard just pause off all these devices now are coming and they're becoming much more affordable they actually start from something like 300 350 US dollars and those prices are going to keep going down as technology improvements um so it's very important another thing I'll show you and I'll talk about it with me is um Windows to go if you see the slide you see the guy was looking a little very respective with Windows 8 you can actually have a computer on a stick so the students Commander hold their own computer for all their fibers the look of the screen is exactly the same and there's a carry around on a stick these sticks cost currently today they were about 100 US dollars they've gone down to fifty dollars in the last six months they will continue to fall I believe it's the students you know first you go around if they have friends or uncles or family or school they can plug in and they have their own computer so this is the thing is like that's really having a big difference here's an example of some of the applications you get on on Windows 8 this is a geometry and in fact all the windows store the highest number of apps on the Windows store today are all education I'm not going to go through this at the time I'm going to talk to you about the fact that remember I said that you can do a lot more in the plan and education now so things like email um SharePoint how you can share files around um web apps they're all free to education for Microsoft you can all these staff and students to be using for free are we managing the cost of the cloud that's a dramatic change teacher Effectiveness is really really very important and one thing I will pick out from this slide is you see level 200 teaching me technology we spend a lot of time working with UNESCO on the teacher training competency framework and as a result of that we've built online training for teachers for 45 hours and which they can go up and teachers how to integrate technology into a curriculum and we've built a certification program around them as well so we now have a teacher certification program based upon online trading history well this is important this is something driven by the University of Melbourne it's called HTC 21s and it's about how we have to change that and we have to start driving it to be more competency-based so things like problem solving teamwork and they go a whole model of how you can start thinking about changing your curriculum and it's so important because employers say they need these skills but I think there was some discussion here today some of the speeches have reinforced this they want different types of skills today that we typically be teaching in schools here is my policy learning networks we built this we've got over 5 million teachers globally on this now this is free results we're going to teach us about the shared content share best practice talk with each other it's available it's another big help and it's growing very very quickly in Africa and this is my last slide application design I think all of these things even the 10 critical components that we have it's all about working together so it's for all of our partners that we work with the governments you have to build a plan it has to be a very careful plan knowing where technology is coming from in the future where we're going how do we get there what do we do first and the right sequences of deployment I think all these things are critical and where they've been done well we've had a very successful rollouts technology broadly where every student uses their own device and with that effectiveness
okay good morning everyone who has joined us today for the final last day of the five days of eLearning we'd like to welcome you today today's our last day for these sessions and big welcome just to ask to find out from everyone just by sure typing a yes or a No type yes if you can hear us type know if you can't hear us okay I'm seeing people can hear us correct great my apologies yesterday for the sound I think today is much better then just to find out by country just type my ear let's see from tuning in this morning from from Rhonda and great-great Kenya Nigeria what am i some of you people we saw a lot of zombie people sign up last night from Zambia a great night Julia Kenya great okay great great thinking now seeing Nigeria sing Uganda yesterday we had some people from Uganda today we have people from sa great great okay so today's our last day for these five days only Lonnie are going to sing people from a thunder thank you so today's our last day for the five days of Alana but it's not the last day of learning we are working on some great sessions for you next week we'll be sharing them with you today I don't have any presentation but for me critical is from the four days that we've read as I was thinking them through last night two questions came into my mind and I decided let's find out so I'd like to put a poll here just to help us see a few things so it's about KPI and strategy in organizations so the first question is which sounds which sounds more likely organization one my organization of a KPI library where we select KPI from each year or two the organization sounds like in my organization we formulate KPI each year as we do goal-setting we can start taking on the poll just to see how things look like the choice is one and two grapes typical starting to take the poll great great then also you can also take question two at the same time the question two is organization has a strategy that has been translated and aligned organization right each department has its strategic couplets with all KPIs for the departments great okay let's take both questions I'm saying we're at 23 percent voted out of 106 people okay let's stop continue taking the pool okay mm-hmm so even though panelists will be seeing what we what we have and how things are looking like okay only about 50 percent of participants have taken the pole the pole is on your screen okay I'll close the poll when we have about 70 people take the poll if you can't see the poll possibly open use steam laser there's a pop-up with a poll oh great okay I think about I'd like to close this poll now but what then I'll share the results in just one okay let's hit 90 at least or let's eat a hundred to let up 18 more people take the poll that we can see have a grave it okay a few more people if you haven't take the taken the poll then you take the poll okay we're 924 right now 86 57 people have taken back this world okay ten more six more and we can close it okay so I'm closing the pool just now we have about 90 yeah we're getting there 97 so three more and then we can close two more one more one more to pull we are at 99 great okay hundred ah so let me share this poll the poll results so from what we've just the small but the poll is just done it looks like organization formulate KPIs each year among the goal don't have KPIs library set out which when you look at question to question the response to question two is conflicting with the polling question one because then if organizations have KPI is listed in their strategy booklets they're not just using it you know we had a question yesterday of how do you formulate KPIs for technical teams right so question one would be able to assist in that response that this is predetermined before not at the goal setting time you have you your strategy from your strategy you have departmental strategy booklets which will have a period for all the rules in that department so today the today's session is being started off by we have two beautiful ladies and from Kenya and our one one gentleman from Nigeria I think in the next session we need to bring in the beautiful ladies from Nigeria - who - poppy the panelists yeah yeah me we given you that assignment to start off this session lilium over to you thank you my team thank you everyone for joining us my name is lillian Geller head of HR demo Trust Bank I have I have 10 years experience actually more than a decade I would not even talk of ten years so and then maybe I'll also talk about DTB DTP is a top-tier bank in the region and we have a branch network across the East African market and what we do basically is just what markets do and then maybe just size that yet yes when it comes to banking I think we are leading in the region in terms of customer service and many a capacity so maybe just to dive in into my presentation before I do that is it a mastiff I this particular topic whereby we we are we are talking about the future and the future is right here with us so the question is then is it future or is it now then I'll talk about now again I'm looking at performance management for a performance management is very very foundational aspect of HR because if we don't encourage properly then it means that any other facet of HR will not go in accordance with what was supposed to be a delivery for our organization so we need to get performance management very very correctly and that is why we need to start the rethinking of performance management we need to look at how can we ensure that performance management is actually working for us so I just dive in it by presentation if you alone I'll share the screen right away if you can't see my screen maybe just yes we can type is yes so this is our classroom actually it's not very easy we are used to having the audience connect stimulus but I think we can still do a good job by connecting with all of us so I think it's doable so one more time the future is now the future is no longer future I think by the virtue of what has happened in the world we have to now look at the now and then performance management you are saying is very very foundational as a HR person we have to look at it differently because without it if we don't untie it properly then any other pasta creature will not take place in accordance with our expectations so let's move to the overview what do I want to share with you at the end of the day what I want to share with you is where are we now with the performance management what are we not doing correctly and what should we start doing so where are we and then secondly we look at so what's the problem with the current models then thirdly I look at so what are the new performance management trends and who will be what are the companies that are currently having the right models in place and I'll talk about the way forward was having looked at all this then we need to know what's the way forward how do we go a forward and then lastly we need to have an illustration we have less pressure solid so that we get to understand that what is the look and feel of the performance that you are talking about so straight away let's move to where and we know the current model you'll agree with me participant over that ladies and gentlemen at the moment would we have is at the end of the year managers the subordinates will set the goals then we have the feeling of appraisal forms which is manually done we have a situation whereby performance management meetings are conducted at the end of the year this is the time you will find leaders sitting or rather team leaders sitting with they act team members to talk about how there has been what has not been achieved what has been achieved and again we are saying this is not practical because how do you get to measure or how do you get to talk about what a tough did in the month of February yet you in December so that is not very very practical again where we are now we are looking at managers and giving rankings to staff or other scoring and ratings and this has to be agreed upon and most of the time you find that the managers will leave then try to or other leaders will try to even make sure that they're within the acceptable distribution which mostly the distribution is a bell curve so this bell curve must be achieved through the campaign so again that is the current situation where are we now lastly most of the time these particular motors are attached to pay raises bonuses and promotions good so having talked about all that in terms of the background where we are and why we need to have an overhaul or rather I researched to how we do performance management we look at so what's the problem with all that so the problem then becomes that and if you look at vision a photo or rather picture what I've seen is this a manager or an employee please just type your answer are you seeing a manager frustrated manager or an employee is frustrated any volunteers a volunteer just type manager employee volunteer okay volunteer so what you're seeing is there's that to me I'm seeing both could be an employee will be a manager and at the end of the day then how do we make sure that we do not have such emotions in the organizations because this is somebody is very frustrated this is somebody who feels a little bit let down this is somebody who is event reading to think of performance management and these are the faces that we keep having at the end of the hotels at the end of the year so therefore this is the blame the system is cumbersome the system is time-consuming the system is expensive very expensive because of most time you find that the trainings that are supposed to be conducted to the actual staff is not the stuff for who are trained are not even the ones who are supposed to be trained because of the misleading facts that we have therefore the expensive which part of which comes in because then we are not directing the actual cost to the right people subjective the current system can be very very subjective because most of the time you find that the leaders opinion is more or less final the motivating very very true most of the time you find that not really motivated because of the way the process is being done and again I'll talk about the process right now I think when I started I talked about rethinking and resetting the PM narrative performance management must not be just it should not be a tool to appraise stuff should not be a tool to start selecting who is supposed to be promoted who needs to get bonus and all that performance management should be a process of ensuring that this growth this development with the in the organization performance management should be very impressive she'll embrace each and every person so that we move along as opposed to having the usual 10% and sorry they're 20% stars then you have the 70% in the middle and then having the 10% were always earn left behind so I think it time for us as HR leaders to embrace each and every person in the organization let's move together in that as we ensure that conductivity and the high performance culture is maintained so there is a bit of sec ret again back to if you look at the bell curve most of the time the bell curve will not be the true picture of what is happening on the ground therefore that bell curve pushes managers to just give many things for the sake of stretching then there is intimidation and device Ignis because again we have those who will always be the stars in the organization then we have those who will always be lagging behind and then the most shocking slide for me I think is the one when numbers don't lie and we never like this is the statistics that was conducted by the corporate executive board the SEBI and you look at the numbers 95 percent of managers are dissatisfied with the traditional PM system yes 95 percent and ninety percent of head of HR are also not believing at the which are not also believing that these performance management current and the prison systems are working for us 90 percent then you have the 94 percent whereby the 94 represent the CEOs who don't believe that actually their systems are effective so I don't know maybe if we could have volunteers at this stage maybe to just share with us experience and the experience or rather Martine I think you can just share with us the the poll on maybe why are we still doing what you're doing the current models why are you using the same models if this is the true picture of what is happening if 90 of us as HR leaders we are not even believing in this system so why are we still conducting the tradition of performance models so a is it the way we have always done it before and B we don't know what the best system is that the case and see is there a modern way to performance monitoring and management so just people if it's a if it's B see let's see why are we still stuck with the old ways of doing performance management we can conduct it differently 120 in the background where we are and what is not working for us having looked at even the Seabees subway why are we still stuck in my country move forward so majority Mathilde you'll tell you say forty people out of 40 of the participants 115 is because it's always the way the epidemics that to 4% is because they don't know if it's a bad system C is their modern way so the people still don't B and C actually show the same thing yeah it's the same answer expressed differently so I could easily add a B and C to be one about 70% 70% don't know what is a per system or anything is a better way to do it yeah yes I sure we do much in and everybody listening to us that's most of the time when you run such a poll the answer or rather the concern is normally on the a is them this is the way we've done it before meaning people are comfortable with the status quo but it's HR leaders we need to now challenge this data school and just make sure that you have the right systems it's please so maybe we can move from there and having said that we can now look at the new performance management trends what should it have in place so one is the focus on outcomes not activities most of the times we focus on activities we focus on what you've know done and how you're gonna do it the question is can we put our focus on the outcome what do you want to achieve - we are looking at the entity focus on the entity not the individual focus on the entity the entity is the department is the organization not the individual therefore this one will give us a very good stand when it - maybe somebody not achieving their targets as opposed to focusing on the mistakes that were done in the past we will now focus on where we want to go and because it's an intensity focus they stay focused on the future they tied one not the past if we focus on the future we are able to to make the goals of the organization as opposed to focusing on the past because the past you cannot change anything in the past you can only change the future you can only show a direction for the future focus on selection and coaching not appraisal yes very very important because when you focus on coaching you are developing you are not sharing that talent you are showing them then that I care and I value your contribution as opposed to when you are appraising that person at the end of the year they make the boss and subordinate jockey accountable very very important because this is a team we are working together in this together as opposed to the moment I got you that moment I got you have to stop the end of the year check in regularly very very important because you're saying why would you wait for only a 12 months or six months to sit down with your staff or your employees to take them through their performance can this be done on a frequent manner can we have conversations actually the new trend is just about conversation it's just about making sure everybody is aware of what is expected of them and you are working together and do you frequent conversations ongoing throughout so those are the chicanes check-ins is basically just the meetings but now in a softer manner because when you talk of meetings people think of a very serious formal conversations check-ins regularly will be very important you think guiding using guided conversations very very project as opposed to those many many forms that we get to feel at the end of the year we need to look at it differently and and replace that with conversations using of technology to generate data can we have a system that is linked to our internal processes so then you're able to mine data and as you do that you are able to have real conversations because you have support documentary of supporting information that you can correct our follow-through keep it simple keep it simple they're very important notes of complex work hard on making it fair fairness is very very important then we can now move to the next slide which is which companies have up dumped the traditional model the tradition of performance wound management model have you looked at them the new p.m. trends the new performance management a trend do you have companies that are currently leading the pack yes very very many and this is just an example actually we have IBM we have the Deloitte's we have Accenture and all that you've seen so next time I challenge to you HR leaders is can we have your companies as well listed in this list of companies that have already acquired a new model performance management system so the question then how are they doing this however they're cheering this which again I'll share with you in my next slide so on the way forward is have you talked about the background we've looked at what is not working what is working for us and therefore we need to now look at the way forward how do we move from here now that we are aware that's actually 90 percent of us are not comfortable with the current systems ninety-four percent of the CEOs globally and having the same conversation around our performance management then what is the way forward very very important so the way forward here is them we need to automate the systems again if you look at our workplaces we have four generations working for us at the moment this is the first time in history where by four generations are working together therefore we need to embrace the Millennials the only way they communicate the only way they know is autumn digital digital digitization and all that so then we make sure that we have the right tools for this particular group but not just for them even for the the older generation meaning that automation is very key as opposed to having heaps and heaps of papers but besides that also automation brings a lot of efficiency I think my colleagues I mentioned these are widely for the past two three days about the need for automation so I'm not gonna dwell on that secondly is regular check-ins very very important we are saying let's have conversations with staff let's get to uplift each other let's inspire the culture of high performance and you can only do this by having regular check-ins by having regular conversations very very important don't wait for a whole four months or three months or six months to sit down a staff to have those conversations have them informally just let them know this is the direction this is what we are doing so those and also you'll learn a lot from your staff when you have regular check-ins the regular check-ins could be on a weekly basis can be on a monthly basis again depending on the nature of your business model because what works for another organization might not work for the other but as long as you have the basics the basics is what you're looking at the fundamentals over the new PM system is very very important so can you first understand the fundamentals then we can now tailor make them to suit our business needs in organisations crowd sourcing very very important to be a saying crowd sourcing is whereby as opposed to having the manager and the staff conducting these review systems can we ensure that you our system incorporates each and every person in the organization meaning for instance team a and Team B so we have maybe IT team and HR team those are teams that work very very closely they depend on each other therefore they need also to review one another as we do that then it's not this system will not be subjective because it means they own the whole organization has participated in individuals performance so crowd sourcing is very very important let's not leave this to manager and stuff but on again as it that leaders let in those the in forward instead of feedback feedback can be very demoralizing because most of the time feedback will dwell on the past feedback on new dwell on the mistakes that have done and have not achieved can we focus on the feed-forward so the feed-forward is actually just feedback works in a way of looking in the future we are talking of which what is the direction how are we going there how you gonna achieve that what is the target and what do I need to do as a leader to ensure that you as my staff you are excelling what is my role as a leader in that person's daily well deliverable because for him today live on for how to deliver I need to support I need to put a few things in place so what are these let's work together let's have a feed-forward as opposed to feedback one minute manager principle very very important because you're saying at the end of the day as much as we're setting expectations are they clear a debrief so there's a setting of expectations that should be very very clear should be very very brief and then we have the praise at the same time you need to as you're giving that expectation to the staff also there is something that they're doing that is so correctly that is so adding value to your department I'd invite you to the organization what is that impact mention to that stuff that impact or that contribution let them know praise them and as you praise them again if there's anything that you have maybe that she is she or he is not doing properly there is a time also to just and give constructive and constructive criticism as you're giving constructive criticism it's about that particular need that was not made that particular deliverable that was not made it's not about the person isn't about Jane or John it is more of that particular and made target so let's be very very brief the one minute manager principle let's be clear legs it's about clarity and just setting the tone embrace a coaching approach very very important I think that ties into my just what I've talked about the coaching approaches you being a coach you being a coach let's not be managers because managing people is not the easiest thing let's be a cooler to be coaches let's work with everyone let's show the way let's dive in it let's be part of the team second last I'll talk about let's generate data that can support the real that other can support conversations the moment you have all your data in place you'll be able to have very constructive conversations very supportive conversations because everything is in black and white so how do we make sure that our internal systems and linked into the PM is very very important if it's your LMS learning learning and development management system how is it linked to your performance management if it's your recruitment everything can we link all that together then you're able to generate the system more data if you have the internal system like for bankers we have an internal system so how do we generate all that data to make sure that we can support the conversations lastly and the most difficult conversation that I think I'll leave it to all of us as a homework is how do we separate a performance management from from the reward system on the bonuses and they pay increments so this is not easiest but it's doable it's doable because when we're having the conversation with stuff can we talk about their career development can we talk about the deliverables can we talk about how do we make sure that that the organization is moving from whatever space we are into the high performance culture how do we increase the predictability productivity how do we ensure growth and development is achieved as opposed to talking about the monetary value that is attached to it let's leave those conversations for another day for another time but not when we are pushing the agenda of performance so he has we can separate you can separate those conversations from time to time it's doable I think it's just a mindset like I began it more mindset change it's more as embracing the need to do it differently yes we are conducting performance appraisal management but we can do it slightly different in a manner of how we are managing the whole process it's about just retweeting the process it's about having more conversations more positive conversations as opposed to waiting for a tool to be used or to be deployed at the end of six months that tool put aside to be used at the end of the year so that we can say we have this budget this much and you want to pay this much bonuses and therefore I only need to use I can only use this tool to get these number of people to fit into my budget no I think we can change your mindset slightly different and look at it as a process that should enable growth and development within the organization so I will say that and now maybe just move it to my slides in terms of an illustration it is not the perfect one but at least it will give an idea of what we can develop or what we can come up with if we are so minded to do so let's see so first and foremost if you can previously what you've talked about is then we should be simple we shall keep it simple we should also again a very maybe I can come back to that later if you look at this leg that is there right now is departmental check-ins it's about the entity is about teams so ensure that when you are setting your objectives you have the bigger overview you have the team or the departmental deliverables at hand that is one because at the end of the day you don't want to come up with anything that is not reflecting your team's performance that is not reflecting your team's the target so what will happen is them have that have that in place and then make sure you have both hat and soft because you're saying soft is very very key actually soft is now the new head I think you've heard of that soft is now the new head and then also look at how do we stop these how do we do away or ban the point of the the 1 2 5 rating the point 5 rating how do we ensure that you don't have the alphabetical orders anymore because those things really are very subjective so if you look at the companies that have already gone ahead with all these the new systems these are the kind of items that or rather their templates that they're using so yes this is just to give a little an illustration but we are not saying that it has to be like that it can be something different but slightly more or less something that can give you that way forward so do you have the departmental check-ins that the check-ins can be done on a monthly basis with your department this is not an individual or can be a weekly process depending on your business model depending on how you operate in terms of because again what works for another organization might not visit that but as long as do we have frequent conversations so good if you look at the colors I'm sure you're asking yourself what is the colors all about so the green will replace our usual five the light green will replace our usual force then the red will replace our usual ones so those are the things so and also talk about that in the later in the next slide then we have the individual check-in out of the departmental you derive the individuals the individual check is now is the one-on-one you and the staff so first we've had a meeting with our department we've agreed on our deliverables we are now going to the individual check-in we're having conversations before we put them down we're gonna cream or now we're gonna agree on the our individual targets this is one on one you and the staff again it is separated into two it's segmented into two firms we have the head and a soft bit we can move now to the feedback to the team very very important because you're saying if you look at the crowdsourcing I'd mentioned earlier on the crowdsourcing crowdsourcing we say it is them just making sure that we get feedback from other teams that we work with because we are dependent on each on one another in terms of operations within the organization the last thing you want is people being the obstacles on the ways of others so therefore think back to the team is very important so if you look at maybe for instance finance this is a feedback to the team so feedback sorry for finance we'll be giving feedback to ICT departments so the fatigue and the first question would be maybe on how are we responsive are we helpful are we quickly intently again if you look at these questions they are more or less on the softer part they're not looking at the hard targets because you are saying if you get the soft right this soft is a new heart once you get the soft skills right the rest will just fall in place so it's important that you work on these and again check on your values of your organization's because the moment you know how to fit in your values then the soft questions will will be very straightforward so you can look at do you work to a high standard are we pleasurable to deal with by doing all these you are changing the mindsets of the staff because you are telling them it's not about you the individual it's about the organization did we meet and support organization strategic objectives this one now comes in because at the end of the day it is about them bigger entity and the overall ratings instead of us talking on the week about the weaknesses and the strengths can we now start talking about keep doing this would you like about that team what is that team doing so well that you want them to keep doing and what can they do better this is now the weaknesses can we change our narratives can we change our vocabularies so then everybody feel part and parcel and in the same boat in terms of where the organization is headed to and good good good perfect perfect good thank you for that so I think I just jump that I'll go to the ratings today rating good so again on the ratings I think is very important like I mentioned before let's replace the colors with the skills so what you can do is maybe you can talk of green green deep being your exceptional and exemplary for performance let's do in being and there are some improvements to be done and so forth and so on so this is what I think will come in it is asked to decide what you want to work with the soft target we will talk about the ethos what do you want to see in that team like for instance do we have a strong team spirit do you work together very very important questions and again as I wind up maybe I can just tell you that as we are now thinking of or as you're thinking of how to make it better in terms of how do we move to where we are supposed to be as opposed to being in these mechanistic bureaucratic processes as we still struggling with that let's be sure and I can guarantee you that there's some organizations that are already having ups the mobile apps where their staff will just log in and rake themselves and this is the one of McKinsey's report - showcasing on where people are at the moment the performance management and now mobile apps and they can be developed developed for our stuff but again there's no one-size-fits-all I think it depends with what we want and and what what's organizations as because if you're to look about look at your business model if you have to look at our strategies and all that then we'll be guided accordingly my parting shot to all of us today is that perfection is the enemy of the progress let's just get started where we are whatever we have let's get started because if you're waiting for us to be perfect if you're waiting for that perfect moment it will never happen but let's get started with wherever we are and the rest we can build on as we move along we can always make it better as we move along thank you so much for listening and I let's connect let's take connected thank you for listening over to you Catherine Catherine story over to you Catherine good morning everyone good morning Kenya good morning Nigeria good morning organda good morning Zambia and everybody else was locked in my name is Catherine were Tressa and I am certified
trainer also performance consultant and shortly I will share with you my slides I'm waiting for Lillian to unshare house and then we can continue with our session my focus today mainly Lillian has touched a lot on has touched on performance management as a whole so I'm going to focus on the employee side of it what they need to do what they don't share okay all right okay so as I had my name is Adan the introduction my name is Catherine Murchison I have 17 years of experience in in HR in consultants in HR and I have 14 years of experiences on N and D and I have 14 years as a no permissions person so who makes presses yeah and it would be quite a lot now I won't just not siding with me today just hold on a bit as I walk on I work on the the presentation itself month mainly what I'm focusing on today is as I've said earlier that I'm focusing on I'm I'm purely focusing on employees and what they need to do to during this time now now it's responding okay sorry for that we're going to do a very rush session so bear with me just fasten your seat belts but you will get the content so don't worry we'll be looking at I'll be able to walk you through such that you can't be able to pick aspects that you can actually help your employees in terms of improving performance in terms of when they are working remotely and my agenda today they are in in three day it's a three prong agenda one is W WH W which stands for y what how and what if and then we have what employees should expect while they're working remotely and key things they need to remember now Martin let's share the first poll I want us to look at what is projecting in front of you there is a red square there is a blue triangle there is a yellow circle and a green screen kindly look at it close your eyes for about three seconds and then when you open what are you drawn towards within those four things that I've drawn in front of you so let's take the poll air will be the red square B will be the blue triangle C will be the yellow circle D will be the green region everyone from this we're seeing the top column is going past a hundred but these percent but this is a guide to what the current station in there in the Indian being be on the ground so we don't move much more focus focus on what's the total just to give us a direction so just on this okay we have one hundred people have just taken the poll will run from one minute and thirty minutes all right I can see how those responding on the chart if you can't possibly respond on the poll that is showing on your screen okay we have a hundred and twenty people or taking the poll if possible if you chart would be if you can't see it it's hidden somewhere on your screen because then one but also chat would help to just see but the best would be to vote on that on the poll itself okay I think we have 140 people who've taken the pool covering we can close yes we can close the poll now okay let me close and then let me share the result okay let's look at the results before we will look at the results let me explain something but is it the people are very different in terms of how they think how they look how they see things now the red square actually is people who are people who are actually focused or who are inclined to be organizers and perfectionist just been mind what Lillian said and her parting shots but it's not a we won't keep you for that then the blue triangle is for leaders and deciders who are inclined to that and then the yellow circle is for people who are inclined to listening and problem solving and then the squiggle is for those who are creative and inventors who are concerned with possibilities now when we look at our poll we find that in terms of the red square we have 30 percent so we have organizers who are 30 percent within us and we have leaders who are about 14 percent we have listeners for about 27 and 34 percent being those who are creating now that is the same way how employees are in the workplace and we have to always remember that that people are absolutely different people look at things very differently people will consider things differently and people will work differently as we think about things working remotely this is what I want people to remember to focus on to think about that looking at the agenda that we have we have the wide the what they how and the what if let's focus on a why must you be productive when everything else seems to be grinding right now and then on the what we are focusing on what do I need to do in order to keep my performance at the top with all the things going on and then we need to also focus on how should I actually co-op out keeping my performance at the top of the game and lastly will be looking at what if I do this what are the next what are the next steps and then what if this is the new normal first covenant meaning this will be the now as we are seeing it now let's dig deeper into this because of we don't know when this will flatline whether a vaccine is found because yesterday we had I don't know whether you able to see in the news that UK is actually doing human testing starting today or there's a hug immunity that is found we don't know when so meaning because you don't know when as an employee you need to adapt and incorporate changes that are going on and as you doing that you need to work as if not that as if but just that the work has changed a trajectory but you're still doing the same work that you're doing now as you're doing the work that you're doing what you need to understand is that there are some things you'll be able to do from where are you working remotely and some you may not be able to do meaning some of the things need to be done in the office and as you're doing that please remember that you have a role as an employee and your role is very key in performance management let's look at the what Lillian mentioned a lot of those she talked of check-ins she talked of making sure all times you do check-ins and from when she's describing she was describing it from the perspective of the employer or you as did you as the manager you as the line manager you as the HR and we're a supervising right now I want you to focus it on the other way you as the employee don't wait for your your supervisor to do the checking you be the one to force the check in and do the one to initiate be the one to initiate their check-in now working remotely what it calls for is soft skills will become very key you're working with people who are in different places you are not seeing them but these soft skills are very specific this soft skills will be the communication active listening adaptability calmness things are a bit rocky right now empathy of your your colleagues having patience because people learn at different levels and understand this technology or systems or everything else at a different level and lastly being positive about what is happening and as you're doing that please focus on quality and not quantity and as you're focusing on quality and not quantity another thing collaboration and teamwork becomes very key for you to achieve what you need to achieve in terms of your performance in the workplace now as you doing that again feed-forward comes in you need to focus on feel for what we are saying is that you do not disregard the feedback as it was said earlier feedback gives historical data that is historical happenings historical activities be cognizant of that take learnings from that but where does your focus lie on feed-forward what is it that you're doing now that you're doing right and then what is it that you need to stop doing and what is it that you need to keep doing in the future so those are the things that you need to focus on as well as now when you are focusing on all that when you look at all that how are you going to do this expectations that may change remember with whatever that is happening right now organizations might have to change either to look at restore today's remember what Agnes and Charles mentioned last week that some organizations are little we look at their strategy we mark it if you're in working your strategy again expectations things will need to change some things will actually change if the negation is not you're working on your strategy it is incumbent in you that you as the employee sit with your line manager sit with your supervisor look at the expection not that I'm working remotely now that I'm starting to work remotely these are my PPAs when we had set them beginning of here if that was how your performance management system when the cycle starts so you look at it that this is what we had set but this is what is happening right now can really work the expectation such that we are still able to achieve what we need to achieve at the end of the day as you working on your expectations look at the tasks that you are actually doing now to be able to achieve those individual objectives that you have been given as you're looking at them make sure that you deliver on those tasks that you have such that at the end of the day you are able to actually achieve what you are supposed to achieve and then make sure remember again it was mentioned earlier schedule regular one-on-ones those one-on-ones in terms of you're having a one-on-one with live alone just the checking the chicken is I can actually quickly talk to you me or talk to Martin or talk to Lena and say by the way learn today this and this and this is going on that's just a check-in but then a regular one-on-one I can now set it with schedule a regular one at the end of every week and say let's recap on this is what we have done that's the feedback but then they feed forward we are looking at next week this is what we are looking at this is what we need to continue so you make sure that you schedule those one-on-ones you as the employee don't sit and wait for you your line manager or your supervisor to set it up for you be proactive and as you're doing that we have mentioned the feed-forward which has actually also been mentioned earlier and then you constantly give status updates don't wait to be asked for those updates please be proactive in everything that you do now as you been for active remember that people have different learning curves this technology tool and this destruction were happening at home where or remotely where you're working now with whatever is happening people are trying to cope with whatever they are so make sure that you trust when your your colleague tells you that they are working on something just what they are saying that they had they are working on whatever they have said but as well as you're trusting them you're just blind trusting them you trust them as well because they have ended them delivered and also you deliver on your beats because right now we are all working from different locations we are not co-located so trust becomes a very very big thing in terms of working remotely and I remember be proactive in terms of which are true for workers leaders and in and even the clients don't wait for them to always be the ones who keep calling you every now and then and as you're working on making sure that you achieve those tasks that you have use the Pomodoro Technique this is how it happened this is how we work on maduro is for every task that you have take 25 minutes working on that task after 25 minutes take a break of 5 minutes wake up walk around come back again and continue working the minute you finish that task for so for every 5 minutes you get up the minute you finish working on that task get up work for for 30 minutes or take a break for 30 minutes and then come back and start a new task that's the Pomodoro Technique for making sure that you complete your tasks at home some organizations have come up with an additional way again adding on the Pomodoro what they do is because in the office there used to be the 10 o'clock of your tea break so every day at 10 o clock everybody logs in with their coffee tea or water choice on drink that they have and then it's a chitchat just the way people would stand by the water coolers and have a chitchat and that's it for 30 minutes and then everybody else can both so nobody puts in nobody shadows a meeting at that particular time for the online coffee breaks it's also um well mentally you know when you see everybody else that used to see physically in the office you also get stop feeling isolated em you connect with them and then make sure that you meet your deliverables and timeline this is very very key when it comes to working remotely this becomes very very important meeting deliverables and timeline and focusing on quality and not and not quantity and as you're doing this remember that unity is strength so when all of you work together these team of these collaboration wonderful things happen that's a thing by much easy step knock now wow that kinds moving very fast let's see the what-if section so what if remote working will be union one what if that is what your organization decides after these orders even from now that this is what will be this is now thinking on the far end like before we catch them what do you need to do you need to start looking at things in terms of they have already changed and there's no going back so you make sure you focus on what you actually need to do and you achieve what you need to achieve that is set for that time and you make sure that your technical skills that that you have that you're constantly making sure that you work on your competence and everything else and at the same time then use of skills that I mentioned earlier the communication skills they are the active listening the adaptability come this empathy patience for other for for your colleagues in terms of them learning and being positive comes into play and then learn to manage app let's just call it what it is people are learning differently in terms of working with the technology working from home and everything else some of our managers have cut up some of our managers have not with what is happening so what happens you find some managers we'll probably after every 30 minutes know if you're working on what you need to work on and at the same time they will ask you what time are you delivering a certain document what time will you be done with a certain task now it is that is why even from Ally I kept saying or or mentioning that you need to be very very proactive do the check-in to yourself don't wait for your manager to do the check-ins and order when you're doing this you're managing up such that it comes to a point that you your manager your supervisor trust you that you'll deliver what you'll deliver and they ease up on micromanagement as they themselves they're also learning that how to manage remotely is main is largely also dependent on deliverable setting deliver important and have any timelines and for delivering best on banks then you deliver deliverables and timelines have to be realized that is the key thing that you need to remember that now that is what you need to do in terms of making sure that you play the part of an employee to achieve what you are said to achieve then what if you have done all this what is the next step to deliver quality of a quantity don't do so many tasks that at the end of the day you check off and you say you have done ten tasks today that is not what is called for right now right now what is called for is quality of quantity they live a quality walk constant communication with you team your manager your the people you collaborate with and your clients that is very a very very key when you meet the deadlines and deliver on deliverables and help others along the way remember teamwork and collaboration very very key right now it helps you collaboration helps you all achieve what needs to achieve and teamwork helps you achieve the projects that yeah so make sure that you help others along the way so that you achieve exactly what the organization needs to achieve so what employees should expect during this time working remotely the calibration of performance markers will be very key in terms of every organization will need to look will be looking back at where the year right now how these covett 19 has impacted their business environment and everything else around them if their strategy would still work meaning at some point the KPI is my you know your manager or your the top management might actually sit down to decide what is the next step for for the organization as they're doing that that means they will be calibrating your KPIs so expect that to happen we open in terms of that will come and then they will be increased application of analytics in performance management we live you me because now we are working remotely we are working online technology even though we have we are having challenges here and there there's support support technologies that will be helping that are helping us in terms of managing our performance so analytics data will be drawn from various places and apart from this also data will be built from even other tools you'll find that even hit in terms of performance management some tools from supply chain some tools from different from accounts can be retooled to actually give you analytics that would work I would give you data that you need for performance management so there will be an increase application of analytics in performance management and they'll be increased agility in performance management remember earlier I really mentioned that we need to stop thinking the traditional performance management that is what she was talking about there needs to be agility in performance management we need to think outside the box we need to be flexible to change with what with the change that is happening right now and I will not dig deeper into that because she actually covered quite a lot in terms of how our mindsets need to change now there will be increased autonomy I come to the meeting remember you'll be well you'll be working remotely as you're working remotely there'll be high accountability that would be called upon from you results will be key actions will be key even though you're not being nobody is very over your shoulder to see whether you doing what you're supposed to be doing what results there'll be no question about whether you're delivering on the results and then as this happens that expect that there will be advantages and disadvantages depending on on each and every person's circumstances where they are if you're working remotely remember some might family settings you might have either grown-up children or small children or call for your attention you may not have working space or you might have a working space so there might be advantages and disadvantages so be cognizant of that as it happens and as you're cognizant of that remember again in that same process there might be miscommunication going on in terms of as you work so with that miscommunication there might be conflict remember when I said in terms of soft skills there you need to have empathy you need to have calmness you need to have patience and have adaptability don't come in very key at this point now as we wind up let's look at the key things to remember as an employee in terms of to help in terms of helping you through performance management seek for feed-forward be sure you can get the feedback it'll be very very a thousand percent not even 100 percent you get the feedback but seek for faithful word deliver quality and not quantity then create a schedule and work on soft skills the soft skills that I mentioned that I think I've been singing and singing please people don't call me soft skills after this and ask for help when you need it and if your colleague asks for help please give it to them and with greater autonomy comes great accountability always remember that always always remember that and tip number seven is open I am being or even you wherever you are be open to changes that are coming that you you will you will experience a lot of changes and be open and and expect those changes and as I pass I want to leave you with this you cannot enslave a mind that knows itself but values itself that understands itself understand yourself understand the value you have by understanding what you need to deliver and deliver that and you become a funny thank you for listening to me and we'll take questions at the end of it yummy oh okay thank you very much so I'm gonna be racing to the finish line after Catherine's be more around performance both from the organizational perspective because we need to have a balanced view to performance we've been talking a bit about the employee and the individual in the organization bar in terms of performance and given the crisis situation right now what exactly she organizationally doing okay so as the form of introduction my name yeah me fascio and I've been in the business of HR about 21 years 12 on 22 now though I move from stares into marketing and then into HR so if you just give me a few seconds to quickly share my screen and yeah I will be talking about [Music] on me given the can we see my screen yummy you can maximize it so that you can be able to see presentations there sure I have maximized the screen now can you say good I think there's nothing they can see yes just give me yes because it is spring you may yes hi Martin can you see my screen yes simply I felt yeah things are there okay okay oh good that week wants to do so it's gonna be organizational performance and business continuity given the coffee 19 situation like I said Lillian and Kathleen the logic concentrated on the individual and how we should ensure performance given the crisis situation we have right now but really who's looking after the organization who's talking about the organization so mine is big in bringing a kind of balance to the situation [Music] matching if you can just run the first poll quickly so that we can see where we're in if we just feel that the organization's are right now okay okay so the question I'm asking is what phase is your organization currently at now are we our crisis situation or are we moved into recovery if we can quickly just give us a student obviously in crisis or as the organization started in cohesion I think we can close up one minute oh wait a number we have 120 people of taking the poll so far okay yeah okay so let's see what the results okay okay all right Wow so 61% says proxies and that you like you say and it says we copy not too bad six people forty sort of a richer okay so let's see as you move on quickly let's see what the what organizations need to be doing right now during a crisis situation as they move on quickly to to recovery so now what why what I think should change and when I say change drastically to given the situation there now the first thing that should change is the mindset we need to stop moving away from crisis to regroup we are not going to see as of then we are not going to succeed in this forever we've been in this now for a couple of weeks and we should have taken some blessings learned and try to look forward to the future so we need to respond from the situation of unpredictability to recovery mode where we think at least in the interim things will be like normal at least in the interim we need to change our focus from inward looking looking at the organization what's working what's not working what do I need to do we need to start looking at the other market now we need to stop looking at the mirror and start looking at the window what is the thing what is gonna be the nation from a stakeholder perspective what will the stickers be expecting from us what is the market saying we need to start moving gradually from a response situation of crisis management to program and man and that'll be a set of new skills new ideas new possibilities they'll move us to recovery mode you need to stop planning for judgment agency and spending on scenarios worst case scenario best-case scenario what's gonna be the outcome of all of this for the organization and last thing we also need to change in our attitude let's stop reacting now let's stop inventing things have changed I know this dream that are spawning unfortunately that's falling on the egg body at the same time so there's not me there is not time for anybody to sit in a spirit of excuses as an organization you need to stop moving the organization things are not gonna be the same what are the business from this continuity planning perspective the business itself crisis management and response what are the business need to do right now what does what does leadership need to concentrate on in the organization this is no sustainable approach so organizational recovery yes is it in a mode however we need to quickly establish a crisis command center if we don't have one by now hmm it's probably almost a bit late but we should have establishing crisis trauma center which is to manage all the logistics but I mean strategic challenges our large Tommo information is key data is key and we are not providing data only to stimuli leadership in the organization information about the organization should be for every employee so we are challenging leaders in the organization please do not keep information to just executive senior management senior leadership team xqo whatever it is information should trickle down to the organization so that we can let you know what's going on I will be surprised the kind of ideas and solution on innovation now from employees it should be the role of the crisis management team to ensure all stakeholders informed about decision and in this instance cicadas will not be just shareholders he would not just be employees the situation we find ourselves in now suggests that we need to move one step forward to speak to our so Paso players as well as our customers they need to be informed about what's going on about the business like I said the commands etosha already be in place and from time to time which was set the pain points and also do a kind of adjustment as we go ahead and see so many leading points now that's about the workforce about the workforce well are we going to have everybody in the business right now performing at the same level optimally are we going to have individuals who are performing optimally some not optimally are we gonna have like ads people we're just coming alone this is the time to define critical clusters for the workforce this is the time to establish for instant [Music] activity and still operate during price please which employees do we need to be our work to support us even if remotely our sort of skills we need in the crisis situation and post crisis we are not going to wait until after the pandemic to start making ads okay the new workforce and the new skill this is the time to start looking at defining our physical clusters for business survival at this point and also for business survivor post pandemic and once we've identified those skill gaps it's not just enough for us to put them somewhere and have conversations we can quickly start bridging those gaps and make sure that we obscure the critical clusters of my employees to support the business now and be ready to support a business going forward there is so many conversations around layoffs around salary costs that's the reality like I said I'm speaking now from a business perspective large businesses are taking a hint we cannot run away from that far businesses are inserting their situation right now so there's setting atomic considerations you too are too funny about layoffs termination ancillary pods but what the business needs to do from a business continuity perspective is to see the real challenges and also make sure the actions are speaking to the realities on ground I for one do not believe that layoffs should be the first report there's so many other things that we can do quickly to stabilize the business or adjust to the new realities for instance which cost areas can we do without now which cost areas for instance can we see can wait till after the crisis is over let Jesus be realistic about how to deal with the internal situation and not go straight to terminations and the first record workforce modeling will help businesses to assess the options and so many governments and so many continents and areas and countries at weekly opportunities to help businesses to survive suck donate politics etc also it is the time for business to see all those opportunities and seeing what we can do to help the business during the crisis situation and again after what is available from from from the government now for business operations culture is going to be very very important somebody said to me in a conversation that how we treat our critical richest people at this time we determine what talent will stay with the organization for pandemic and that's the reality so we need to treat the resilient culture at this time organizations need to exaggerate we work in a collaborative manner I mean everybody's working from home from remote areas from the farm from anywhere and we're still getting things done because we are collaborate we need to emphasize more on that culture and say guys whoever we are may still one you need one family one of the musician and we need to go through this together now the ship has moved from a workplace situation to an ecosystem the organization itself has become an ecosystem and we need to leverage on social vehicles of collaboration to make sure that employees can still have access to data information walk use etc so that we can go through this period together and if there was a time for the organised additional to be to be elastic this is that we need to be human floss machine waffles and and I'm saying I'm not saying machine from strictly a robot perspective even if it's communication even if it's anything that'll make trust transactional processes continue this is the time to make sure that ionization is focusing on that through our tea box to reduce the stress on the officials of the business and this is the time also for organizations to move from I said that we had a wave of employee satisfaction we move to employee engagement now its employee experience but now I think what's gonna be more important to get through this phase will be the human experience that organizations bring to the workforce tax entry stimulus packages all around countries and organizations what can we do to take advantage of search for some companies may be the approach in different jurisdictions global urbanization what can we do in country a to leverage on country B taxes long form of stimulus and changes in tax rates and duties and help pump needs to at this point conserve their cash position and therefore have an opportunity to plan for the future businesses need to look at what central banks are doing a ducati interest rates and the extending grants and also the business so let's not just look inwards into the operations of the business what can I do to survive it's also the time to move out of new parts of the window and see what the opportunities are for visit from the continuity plus financial liquidity this is a time because you reveal the cash flow and any foreign [Music] because those facts flat areas Poindexter has technique which means what is it trying to signal really critically review the current concentration for organizations we need to prepare these about key suppliers and critical payments something makes me to be done immediately some can be deferred going to take some level of of critical thought process for Avada but we can't just limit our considerations to just the organization let's to custom players let's look at remains what do we need to do now what can we do or the fancy later we need to see where cash public funds conserved and if possible orders of business from supplier that would not make critical sense at this point can be delayed it can be deferred and I mean focus on securing what stimulus packages might be available in a particular country unfortunately I'm working in multiple multiple locations this is also in time to see like I say what does that mean in one country that we are living on for another country there are some implications for the strategy as well of the business as well as the brand some implication now given the crime scene situation what how is your brand going to be perceived I need just that organization who still wants to sell by all means we just want to move our pressures from physical officials to online officials customers customers customers some organizatio
s are offering services right now are discounts or for free and that for us to balance commercial continuity with community concern I see so many organizations in my part of the world who are involved in helping the flow of the ports of through these crises it's not just about selling it's not just about business continuity brand perception will be important for this period and how you make people feel now they will not forget whatever you say they may forget but how you make them feel they will not forget so it's important that what we what a brand is communicating at this point is more around community concern balance with commercial continuity maybe there's a way for business so sweet to me without selling just moved from I mean it's time you reach the market everybody everything is online right now school is online gym is online business its online everything is on its own move can we move the business can we find new routes to market for business survival and agility is so so critical this is not the time to deal around bureaucracy long hours of decision making no this is the time to stay close to customers stay close to them not just from a product profit profit margin revenue perspective but also their well-being understand how behavior is changing understand that those behaviors might just be the new normal and we are not going to go back to the old or scenario so until it is quite people driven by data of course so what's the road to recovery looking like from my perspective and this is taking from some sort of instance from Deloitte what we need to do is ask some critical questions around revenue profitability assets liquidity digital transformation the workforce itself and your kitchen structure as well how to manage our security expected engage our minds from a revenue perspective will be things around me and is possible for acquisition or maintenance what is our strategy around the minion growth you know be like what customer behavioral changes are likely to be permanent and like promise you there's so many behavior develop patterns that are contrasting things will now go back to business she will manage for profit or she will manage for resilience for business continuity at the spawn she will operate for cash or should we operate for profit some businesses will say cash is king hold your cash right how can we move faster toward digital transformation I mean this is this is probably a question that is about about three four weeks too late if there is any organization that is not moving very very fast well digital transformation that business is likely to become a dinosaur love these how the social controlling what has changed the social contract workers has changed by the time we get back to the workplace needs if I'm going to be the same thing I know some individuals who will say come up we do full time eighty-five money to fighting anymore I just want to give you three days of my three days on my feet and I want to do something else for myself or with family or another job the switcher contract will change how are we going to be able to manage the operation structures analyst is to deliver the plan from a workforce perspective and lastly how have social and institutional expectations changed those are being impacted directly by the situation that we are right now and it is the business of the business to find or to situate itself amongst the expectations and possibly the model is some business operations so that expectations can be can be delivered the recovery journey this is how I see and I think it's going to be from the way we respond right now the second thing is to identify and navigate your settings is an invitation that's not mature number one have a change in our mindset number two I didn't fly and navigate the uncertainty and implications number three trust it will be very very important someone that I shall build the operation of the walk was a run clocking at eight o'clock out at five I can see Amy's working I can see pattern is working I can see Dan is working you know we built the organizations are runs trust such structures but now I don't know where Yanni's but she's working I don't know where Katherine is so trust is gonna be a very very important element as what we'll watch with leaders to quick recovery it's gonna become a catalyst or three to recovery employees we need to throw themselves Lyman just we need to translate their reports the workforce we need to trust leadership otherwise recovery will be thing is to define the destination so really what's the new wasn't new definite destination gonna be like the business strategy that we had in January or of Japan remember last year planning for 2020 that has changed that has totally totally changed it's a new ballgame we need to do need to redefine the destination and launch the recovery the recovery framework for the business otherwise we are still stuck in the root of what's going on what's what's gonna happen I know that they're not gonna be able to move so me to move from a state of responding now to the point where we need to thrive maybe not in the present situation of the crisis from an operational perspective all at least let's get ready to quickly go through the curve respond identify the issues and bed trust in the organization define the destination and there is five again this point I'll just see the machines to take over and then if we have questions for members of the panel then we can take those questions thank you very much you me thank you very much there was a poll that you had for love completing the session I think what I'll do is I'll launch the poll and then we can have before responding to it as in generality roses yes so we are

everyone
hi my name is afrika and i hope you are doing good i want to take this opportunity to wish you well in these difficult times i know it is challenging for many of us because we are compelled to switch from what we are used to that is face-to-face lectures to an online medium but i think that it is possible if we know how to use it the purpose of this video is to show you how to access download and make use of all the course materials that are placed on the e-learning platform by your lecturers in our previous video we said that before you can access your e-learning platform you are supposed to log into the e-learning account that is your personal account and we said that you need username and password to enable you log into your own account in case you have any difficulty logging into your account you may have to refer to our previous video so i've entered my username and i've also entered my password the next thing is to hit on login to take me into my account when your account opens this is what you are likely to see so on my screen i can see a number of boxes every box is a course so if you have been enrolled in 20 courses you are going to see 20 boxes down here if you have been enrolled in seven courses you are going to see seven boxes over here so for example this box is for size 242 this box is for math 906. this box is for echo 947 there are other two boxes over here recently assessed courses they are the courses i have opened before or the courses i opened not long ago so let's say if i open ema 553 the next time i log in it will also be here so that there will be three boxes up here so all the courses here are the courses you opened or you have opened before on the top here i can see home i can see dashboard events and my courses when you bring the closer to my courses all the courses you have been enrolled in will appear so you can see that on the screen so if you have been enrolled in 10 courses it will appear in a list form like you can see on the screen so you can either open a course page from here or using the boxes i showed you early on so let's say i want to open signs two four two i just have to bring the cursor to the name of the course which has appeared and then i will click on it then it will open the course page for science 242 for me which is introduction to biology one so this is the course page for one course the name of the course is introduction to biology one science 242 so this is how the lecturer has arranged items on the course page note that yours can be chemistry african studies biology mathematics any course you can mention so the first thing i can see on this course page is you are welcome to introduction to biology one course speech blah blah blah blah the next section is announcement this is where the lecture will put every announcement he wants you to follow for example this course the lecturer said that the announcement is that they are supposed to download the course outline and you place the course online right beneath the announcement all you need to do is to double click on the material which is the course outline and your browser will download it for you so look at it alright so my browser downloads and it opens for me it means that my system has saved that document automatically so i just have to click on the material and i get it so i've downloaded the course online so let's get into the main issues in this course that is the content so you scroll down all right so the lecturer is saying that week one the topic is microorganisms and under the topic are the objectives so he has stated a number of objectives here for this particular topic now under the objectives are the materials associated with this topic microorganisms so he has placed a book under the objectives if you want to get this book all you need to do is to double click on the book and the book will be downloaded and saved on your machine so let's see all right so this is the book for microorganisms so you have gotten the book it's saved already after you double click on it it's saved already all right okay so i can close it now the lecture also found out that there is a video on youtube an external source which is relevant to microorganisms so he inserted the link to that video also under that topic under microorganisms if you want to get the video you would have to click on the link and then it will take you to the external source where that video is where you can download or just watch hello friends today we'll study about microorganisms alright so you get the video you can download the living organism apart from you and me let's go to week two so we scroll down so we to topic my mouth and objectives are stated clearly here under the objectives are the materials associated with that topic so the first material is the powerpoint presentation of the lecture if you want to get it you double click on it and it opens the powerpoint for you and you can study it there's another video the lecturer inserted the lecturer found another video that is also relevant to the topic mammals on youtube he inserted it writing if you wanted to double click on it and it will open on the external source for you hi i'm emerald robinson and in this what is video we'll answer the question what is a mammal mammals are a group of warm-blooded animals that have hair or fur and secrete milk to feed their young all mammals are classified in the eukarya domain since their cells have nuclei so you can download or watch it but there is another thing we can see here this is a video that is not on an external source so the lecturer inserted the video right on the e-learning platform all you need to do is to double click on it and that video will download and saved on your machine all right so the video will play and your browser will download it for you all right so it continues to get to the last week of the semester which will perhaps be the last topic and that is all you need to know but there is another clue i want to give you there are some lecturers who not give objectives on their course pages so what they will do is that lecture one then they will set the material so micro organisms assignment and then a link all you need to do is to double click on the material and it will download for you as i have demonstrated early on there is no different thing in relation to this you just have to double click on them and they will download accordingly for you so i want to click on the assignment and see all right so it downloads for me my machine says it and i can work on it anytime i want in our next video we are going to look at how to participate in a live lecture what you need to do how you can actively participate and what is expected of you kindly subscribe to be part of this family so that we can learn together thank you very much
om our experiences to come up with some kind of guidelines that we can put together and that we can distribute amongst ourselves and panel bit and come up with something that we can use in institutions in order to enhance the quality of online learning so i'm looking forward to what people are posting over the week and i will be responding to those posts regularly and in the end i hope we're going to end up with them a draft instrument let me at this point entertain any questions that people may have been in questions that people may have you can post them in there and our response to them um dr molanga as as you wait for them to post there was one that was raised a little earlier um yeah about equity about quality and equity um yes nancy says um i'm listening for issues around quality and equity which has been coming up a lot in many circles in my life so um yes what is your take on uh quality and equity as we wait for the others to type their questions yes thank you yes we are very much interrelated when it comes to educational provision i i think if we are to have equitable um access to education and educational facilities we must also take into account the quality of that provision for instance if you surmise that in your country rural children are not provided with sufficient education and then you probably build schools and then they have someone to go in order to learn you must then provide them with them sufficient resources like books like teachers so that they can also get quite good quality education otherwise if you don't provide them with good quality education you will not have done much in order to achieve equity so equity and quality in terms of education tend to go hand in glove and everything goes down to the very first quotation that i had that let's not only um focus on providing access let's also focus on providing epistemic access quality access and a week ago last month of july i was facilitating a commonwealth of learning a discussion forum discussion on quality and equity in learning and i can i can refer the participant to the relevant site and you can be able to see some of the summarizations that we made on on that topic out of the discussions that we that we held that month so yes they too are intricately related um when it comes to educational provision any yes there's a question here i'm wondering i wonder if we always assess equity first and use that as a launch patch to any other assessments for quality okay what comes first i'm not really sure what comes first or if the two things don't always work together probably um yes you may you may think of uh putting in place the right facilities for people to access education but as you do that you you must have already planned you might have already planned the quality of education that you're going to offer them because if you don't do that then you will not have put in place mechanisms to ensure that you roll out good quality education so qualitation's processes must be thought about must be planned for and must be put in place right from the offset you may not achieve the standards that you want to actually achieve when you start but you strive you work towards achieving them you will have defined them here already and you will know what exactly you want to achieve and you work towards them um we are little um of our time so probably you can answer one more question and then we we can continue the discussion in the forums please thank you yes that's right i am looking for questions here and um i'm trying to figure out this one let's see here um it doesn't look like it's a question with my younger students from the egg university no longer teaching this course their own agency is the lena in the world seems to predicate the quality i don't see that anymore i think it just moved yes i don't think it's a question i think it's just a post that she put irene i don't think there are any more questions to answer in this session if people have any please just post them in the forum during the course of this week and i'll be happy to respond to them but also just to remind you that we have another one-hour live session on thursday next week starting at the same time half-past e3 uh southern africa central african time oh thank you thank you so much um this has been a wonderful session one hour already and some few minutes on top we've provided the the links to where the forum uh to the forum and we can continue the discussions there uh we shall be sending you a few reminders of the next um life meeting that we shall have on thursday we are looking forward to having all of you um join us again and we wish to thank dr mulanga for such a wonderful presentation there are so many people offered some collab collaboration of some sort here and there so i hope he can take it all into the forum and then come up with something by the end of the week so um so um dr molang any last words before we close down the session please i would be very happy and excited if we managed to come up with a drafts tool at the end of the week thank you okay great thank you so much everyone um for those who are um in the morning uh have a good day um for those who are in the evening have a good evening and uh let's see you on thursday and also in the forums we shall and also write your own topics if you if you feel what we've raised is not addressing what you'd like you can also raise your own topic in the forum please feel free and so good evening and thank you very much for being here see you on thursday and see you online bye for now thank you very much thank you so much irene and frame for this excellent session irene i'm happy that we have power and electricity and connection to you in kenya and thank you to you iframe as well what i'm going to do now is to switch off the the recording of this session
the year is 2004 and there is a very enthusiastic college student about to finish my degree in finance ready to conquer the world ready to solve the financial problems of africa already believing that finance is the problem that exists in africa and then i owned my first computer each day i sit on it my fingers scribbling over those characters trying something new each day i tried something new each day i told myself i will not sleep until i get something new and then the day came when i now believed that i know something when i now believed that i had it when now i believed to myself that i knew it all then i finished my college degree and by then i no longer call myself a finance graduate i'm now a self-acclaimed software engineer ready to tackle the world ready to conquer the world and then years later i found myself working in the education sector and there i am working again with technology ready to see the world running but facing the same challenges that africa still had challenges in poverty challenges in health and now i'm wondering how do we solve these problems in africa there i left my finance degree believing that with finances we were going to solve the problems in africa and then a very good friend of mine taught me the friend i did not have when i started doing my experiments the friends that the friend that we always carry in our pockets each day we walk around that little friend called the internet then the internet taught me one good thing that africa's problem is not going to be solved by money africa's problem is not going to be solved by finances but africa's problem is going to be solved by education now i'm in the sector now i'm seeing the education i'm going rural area by rural area putting computers in schools training teachers on how to use those computers training teachers on how to teach using those icts and i realized after a year that all that i did was to impart just about a hundred schools out of eight thousand schools in one nation out of more than 27 million learners in the whole of africa and back i was again thinking how then are we going to solve the problems of africa when i can only reach this much where can i when i can only do this much and then i realized that the problem is not with what i'm doing but the problem is in what i'm not doing then i looked at what we had in africa every person who moves around every day now has a mobile phone even my grandmom in the rural areas has got a phone that i bought her just for me to use to check on her how she's doing everywhere i go i see litter litter of scratch cuts that i used to juice up your air time then i think to myself how do i reach africa and provide that quality education that i'm giving just to these hundred schools in every year how am i going to reach my 27 million students using that same technology that i'm seeing every day and then we came up with a solution called mobile learning now that rural area child is able to get education that is being found here in the capital city all they need is the very same device that they are using every day all they need is to just ask the grandmom that i gave that mobile phone to say can i use it for just 30 minutes but then the next problem was now i have a solution on how to solve the problem of access but how am i going to make money was making a difference and then i looked again outside and i saw again the litter this crash card and then i remembered the technology is not what is going to come but we have enough technology to change africa and that's how i came up with a product called an edu card where a child from the rural areas go to a eight-time vendor and buys this card and they have access to quality education that you are seeing students getting in your top schools then i got to realize that africa's problems are not going to be solved by new inventions but the technology that exists amongst us the technology that we interact with every day is the very same technology that we need to solve the problems of africa and the problems of africa just need us to apply that technology in education thank you you
nt to address when we talk about mother T based education or mother T bilingual education now once we establish that we go into training okay we we train teachers not only for mother tongue B education but teachers for math science we we train them seriously and make sure that they properly trained and then we go back we say for mother T we need to train people in the pedagogy of teaching Mother Tong if you go to most member states in Africa I can give you my country as an example and I will bear the consequences of that if people come to me is that we have people who goes to the teacher training College they are trying to teach you know the tech the method is about teaching Portuguese and we think they can teach the mother Tong because they've learned to teach no Portuguese is a second language it won't work so we need to focus on the training teachers for mother Tang based education we need to train teachers for all the other subjects and we need to produce materials good quality materials which they will be attractive to the Learners you know they want p that were wasting their time we playing the the game of the chicken in my Village you put the head under the wing it ends up sleeping you you don't want to do that you you want people to take you seriously so you know there's a constellation of actions which need to be in place before we can start here in South Africa if you look at the teacher training for example at one point it was with the teacher training colleges and then it next mov it University I don't know where it is now now but we need to consolidate experience we need to do research for example and know that this is the methodology we need to do if you do M Tang based education the transition period how do you do it so is a holistic approach we need not just one you know size fit all it won't work because what you have now in most African countries is that we don't teach our kids English very well we don't teach them our mother tongue very well so I don't know what we are teaching them so we need to really go back to the drawing board and say let's have a system which will have all the Micro Systems in place for mang based education to work this is how I see it is there an opportunity and you you kind of almost gly referenced for ir and you know whenever the fourth Industrial Revolution is coming to use technology to our advantage in this endeavor that that you think is obvious that that that we to this point have not been using yes we we we need first of all we need to to do research for example we have sadic you know it's it's it's the W the regional economic in know Community for our region here we need together come together remember we share some of the languages we need to do serious research we need to record best practices you know we say this worked in South Africa it work in MOS it worked in bana why and how once we consolidate all that knowledge we bring the experts technology forth Revolution to say to them look here this is what we have distilled you know from our experience now now we want you to put it into the machine because this Force Revolution I understand includes softwar computers machine and things like that so this is what we need to work with you together and and when we do it we'll tell you no no no no from the teaching point of view this what we are missing let's go this way and that way and I think if we we did that seriously in a continuous manner we share experience we record the best practices we can probably get where we've never been before now if we we didn't we don't do that I'm afraid this is my own opinion the first Revolution it will be for very few beautiful ones like you know so and that's what we don't technology to keep on dividing people you know we always talk about Bridging the whatever divide but we we need to do what I'm suggesting I think this is the most reasonable way of doing it if not the correct one it is my opinion and Before I Let You Go the last thing to ask I guess is what is your current preoccupation with in so far as any research or work that you're currently busy with that's that's taking up a lot of your time I I look into I remember I said into the interplay between language and development uh language and um uh conflict uh uh prevention management and the resolution language and development can we really develop in Africa in the way that we change uh our lives for the better excluding the vast majority of us you know you can invent Hightech things but if they are not user friendly because people don't understand the language they speak then I think you better not you know waste any resources because you need to reach out so this has been my main uh preoccupation I still supervise the students I still am busy we should have finished that long time ago but for various reasons took us many years to finish a book on language between the interplay between language and democracy you know how do you instill the culture democracy respect for human rights in a language people don't speak and I've got a metaphor I like when I speak to my students I said look here food cooked in borrowed pts will never kill hunger because you know by the time you are trying to go and buy the ingredients the own of the pot say can I have my pots and sometimes I tell them about the S I said you know you know each hour they think the S use for driving away the evil spirit is if you if borrows one from somebody else it won't work it won't do the trick these are the things I believe in they have been keeping me busy you know you you can't kill anger with food cooked in borrowed pots you can do whatever you want that won't happen well I think that is the perfect point for us to leave it and I do hope that before the village gains you once again that we we we get some more use out of you before you disappear back to the village and speaking Portuguese Soo this has been fantastic I I I thank you so much for for your time and for sharing so openly and so so generously it's been a pleasure no thank you very much for for for you to reach out to me uh these are the things I believe in these how I see them you know it's like dancing you know say well whether I dance well or not not but this is the way I  dance many thanks to Soho for his time and especially for those wonderful metaphors thanks also to you for listening if you've enjoyed our time together please rate and subscribe to the podcast and share it widely for more information on the courses webinars and virtual

 the eastern cape department of education has embarked on an ict drive which started with giving teachers laptops and now learners e-learning devices the 404 million brand investment that the department has made has incredible aspects for the learner which include the following the samsung device security features as part of knox in casing and screen guard educational applications four gigabytes of data engraving and setup costs continuous maintenance and delivery the devices will help learners ensure they get an edge in terms of competing with their counterparts during the handover process the security measures are tight and all the devices are accounted for at every school the teachers are also excited about what they will be able to do with the tablet relying on the textbook alone is not enough but with the use of these tablets that they have been given we only hope that this is going to improve their performance as well as long as they are able to use them effectively and access the relevant information while some may question the investment learners in comani are excited about the e-learning devices and i'm quite excited about these tablets that we have received i mean anything that has to do with technology makes life easier i think this is an excellent initiative i think this will ease out any anxieties we had as great house i feel very privileged to be given the tablet and i promise to use it very efficiently and we have to make sure we pass the flying colors because of this illustrious device the department is spending this money to ensure that even in covert 19 learners and teachers have access to each other  while the total cost of the contract is 404 million rand this is going to be spread over three years this means that per learner per month over the next three years we are spending 204 rand per learner per month the other unsaid benefit of this is that we will reach 165 000 learners over the next three years i feel blessed about these tablets and uh they have helped me so much so like i have easy access and we also have given the learners booklets that will assist them to use the devices efficiently and give an orientation to the learners so in a case if the schools close there will be broadcasting lessons so you can receive it on your tablets that's the one purpose of it the other purpose is the electronic textbook like we showed you earlier you've got the two enable app on it that has most of your subjects on there so you can do revision you can take online tests there measure yourself the department is proud of the investment that it has made in ict to better the future of our learners and they love it you
good morning my name is george matheka a clinical officer from oliver medical center atunza franchise clinic i wish to thank uh p.s kenya for the opportunity that they gave us in training actually through what's up uh the platform was very timely because this year we've had the covered and there was no opportunity for training and we embarked on the whatsapp training which was very easy to maneuver and navigate through the whatsapp platform and my experience was quite good because it was self-test you would learn the modules at your own time at your free time assimilate the knowledge and uh put into practice what you have been able to learn on time it was within the facility in which you can put in to practice what you've been taught immediately population services kenya and psi in collaboration with the kenya ministry of health have designed and implemented a remote training solution to deliver covid19 training to over 1 000 private sector health workers internet penetration in kenya is 87 with two thirds of users connecting via smart phones nine out of ten mobile internet users also have whatsapp to automate the interactive learning experience we adapted the official ministry of health covet 19 training curriculum to run using chatbot software this was specifically tailored for whatsapp hence delivering a learning experience through a channel that is familiar to the target audience learning methods include text images and videos videos can be seen by clicking on a link in the chat bot which then takes you to youtube and in this example you can see a demonstration of doffing ppe also included in the course are downloadable resources and links to further reading evaluation methods include self-assessment exercises and a pre and post-test questionnaire it also includes a statement of accomplishment upon completing each post test and lastly we have a dashboard this gives us real-time data into who is accessing the platform how they're progressing through the modules and how they're performing on the pre-imposed tests i wish that we could have more trainings on on through the whatsapp platform besides the covet i believe we support es kenya and all the other partners who have facilitated that training we wish to thank you all you

foreign from starting from this document we should just increase the size of the presentation probably if it's too small it will just think it will show you the entire uh list of table of contents if you oops decrease the size a bit so if you have more space you see those changes actually on the side of this table of contents opened and so your first task is to reorganize this structure of these headers which are actually chapters I changed this already for paragraph but also for lists stories to mirror this structure so our chapter is tutorial there is the first section is markdown and it's divided to paragraphs lists which are the subsection of numbered list just by adding these mirror this structure just by adding hashtags in front of these headers so that is clear depending on the number of hashtags you indent or move these yeah headers into the structure or into your content you just add some hit Ctrl s and see the changes I just like you probably go back to the food structure to illustrate oh sorry I didn't show it Facebook like this yeah so like like this you see so just or if you prefer another one just add more indentation you can do this up to six is actually allowed to like with a HTML Syntax for had a one header two had a three up till six and this is just mirroring this text actually this html text oops there's one two  yeah so already if it's not perfect it's not necessary but that you have an idea so depending on I structure my contents with this hashtag title and depending on the number of hashtags I indent this at this only you just for illustration you can show the connection between the preview and the actual code by clicking on a certain location and to jump to the corresponding and symptom uh no it's not working with uh if you can do this it's a bit complicated control and double click you can control double click you can but the easiest way is just like if you go to the next slide I want to go to this specific part you just double double click onto it and it will jump into the line accordingly so it's you can navigate between your code or it's not code between your mockup language in between the presentation so for me it's a bit difficult control double click and here is a bit easier just double click to the specific right so if we are done with this so it's actually the the idea of markdown is that's easy to write and easy to read and every block that you generate stands for its own and if you do something like a paragraph for example it's always divided from other blocks by an empty line so this is just like you see that there's a difference I add a it's a new line we compile this and this will be a separate paragraph if I remove the space between them just like this will be added automatically to this paragraph It's just like also for later the other blocks are simply separated by new lines so it's easy to read it's easy to write it's easy to separate you can actually if you have also like this so this is a another error graph I compile this again so we'll just run or generate this like visualize this like this way so it don't care about the amount of spaces it just has to be one empty line at least so but you can organize your content as you like if you want to use two or three lines for certain cases you are free to do this so actually yeah so the task probably if you try this out for this one was to add simply by yourself add a few paragraphs but if you have done this we can go on and just like the idea is clear right so just nothing fancy just like if you would just think about this if you just would have it have a typewriter and a paper and just and you try to organize your content in the old school way with a typewriter this would be something similar or the simplest way so if we go to the next one lists lists are the same like you use this or increases better to see just like again if you use a typewriter you'll probably you can start with a star or Asterix a minus or a plus so if I add the minus in there it doesn't care it will generate the same for you so just like an enumeration and a list so you add in this case you don't have to add any new line it will recognize so there's another bullet point but if I want to add another paragraph for example to this one so you have to keep in mind you have to use the indentation so that it belongs so the part that I'm writing now another important as pect will be rendered as a second paragraph but within this bullet point so you can also add as much as paragraphs or other markdown blocks as we'll we'll see later into it it's just idea but just keep the indentation and the same goes with if you want to add in a bullet point list to your bullet point list actually it's done in the same way I just separate them by a new line and I start the new bullet point list probably it's easier to use pluses or minuses to switch between the indentation but what I then have to keep in mind is just like this requires one two additional spaces and then it's added like a sub bullet point list into this field so let's indentation and empty lines so this is the basic idea of mocktail so and we add some additional features so so far okay the first one at least this one yeah another important aspect there is still combining it to the first items uh the blank one yeah if I do it like this so it will be one paragraph yeah so just like bullets you want to add either like you can do as a star another bullet like in this case or if I want to do it at this back so we'll do it like this is just uh yeah no it's not hello it's just because uh uh marked it like this so so how did you do this like at that you see how we added that another project this yes so uh it's just one it looks different but this is not a new line it's just if I decrease the size it's actually a one-liner 80 and 81. it looks like this it's just a long line but with a line break that's rendered like this but yeah if you want to add this you can also add a plus if you want to and nothing changes so it's part of this but if you want to add another bullet point list probably to this one what I'm doing so we have to take care of the spaces of this this has to be a new line and not filled with spaces so we added another bullet point list and this can have not just  the benefits if you have such a structure implemented in HTML it's much more complex so overhead for illustrating this part belongs to it is and this goes on and on until your browser don't know where it puts it into it it's just like so and the design of the bullets is just like the star or Asterix minus and plus so these are the but if it's like a full circle empty circle or a box ah yes this is predefined within the style but I think you can choose also if you are a bit into coding another style if you want to and uh change the view it could be used something else if you want to if you don't like the blue color you can also switch to green radish one or also add another one this will be recognized and there's another custom style and it will render the content within your with your fonts with your colors and stuff like this so yeah and because it says here Dreamweaver editor Style ah no this is the style if you are doing coding and there's an editor and you can use different types of syntax highlighting depending if you want to have a dark background or white background and this is this is deferred by the style okay okay to check this talk to teachers grip and the application in schools then they are completely becoming completely nervous by the black background of the editors so normally we switch to a white background which does not transport that nerd image but for you guys it's no problem I guess so as you've seen those I think you're all ready right so we go on to the we have this bullet points and then other bonus we just want to have a numbered list so as you would do this probably just like with a number and the dots and the space so that's it and you can basically add as much as numbers to it another number hit control and so you now you have like if you want to do the same you add once you add another paragraph or something like this these are now three uh spaces to be in row also it has to be enrolled Always by the upper definition and another uh so another one but you can also and combine this completely for free you can add also bullet point lists so the idea of markdown is a basic simple box and you combine can combine everything that you wanted so this one I want to add some bullet points to the second one you have to keep one two three into three so that it's in row and so this will be a simple bullet point list here if I want to add some numbers probably these could be numbers also they appeared like this or if I add some more indentation like oops two two these become part of this bullet point list so that's basically it and you can combine them reuse them the only thing that's a bit different to standard markdown is uh standard markdown if I had number two or three for example in this case it will always render this one for you with uh starting with one two three four five so it doesn't depend on the numbers but in Leah script actually so you could also add one one one those numbers have a meaning so if you want to create your content for a specific part and you want to start with a third bullet or a third part or the second one because you want to reorganize this you can do this just change the order of your numbers in markdown this won't work so it will always start by counting from one to n and I added the Wikipedia entry I also use but it's a different it's a bookie marker but I don't know how it's called it's similar but different same same but different with some so the next one is to use markdown as the basis to Wikipedia is exposed due to the estimate that they use a markdown for this project but it's a static web page you can make some sense for you to use it for learning content yeah I also found the markdown sheet sheet I copied the link in the lia yeah where is it yeah yeah this is a basic markdown syntax you can use it's the same principle it's an open standard actually so now we want to add some basic formatting or highlighting of text elements probably and you can see there's not highlighted actually the only part that looks a bit different is this code so if you use those backticks in my case I don't know depending on your keyboard it's actually it's called a backtick so this might be a look like complicated but this is just a piece of code where uh which stays the same it doesn't change it reminds that this is a code and whatever is within there display it as it is so if I want to use a bullet point list probably test so it will not display the bullet point list but the syntax as it is so this is just like an uh leave it like it is and don't change it this is some piece of code that should not be changed uh adapted any in any way so you can use this also for C code or to add some Snippets so this is just a basic code back text so this is just to remember if you want to have something like italic you can use stars and underscores or Asterix and you simply highlight this piece of Code by surrounding it with underscores probably that's better readable than to use another Stars so as you can see those specific part is now an italic I can also move the you just add this for you the task is to add this specific notation around your uh main title of this bullet point or something like this but depending on within the one liner with the wrong one yeah I just wanted to edit like in here so depending on how much you surround so this could be one word or multiple words these are there's a highlight for italic and as you can see visually okay this must be somehow important probably within the code so if you have something that's more important so you can see you can either use two asterisks or two italics to surround this so this should be bold you see the syntax highlighter already shows this in bolts but now we've created like a a bold thing so still text it's not HTML markdown we have to remember it's just like this one seems to be more important than this one if I had this bag so now it's like and if it's very very important you might say okay but what do it I just increase it by a second number it's just like it's becomes italic and bold so the same idea just one two three one two three so we now have bold and italic and if you you can use this also to embed different stuff so important if I just want to have this in bold so both but I want to have this italic piece probably like this is the only one I want to have in italic you can surround this also with Stars so it's just like embedded or put into parentheses so this is italic and the other one is just like circumvented with two underscores this is bold in this case so you can mix up everything this is the idea sort of if you can work around this so everything that you use in markdown is actually you can use combinations of difference so we have now this bold cold block which doesn't use this Stars actually but if you get those from your keyboard it's on my keyboard it's uh where the backspace is there's like an uh like the axon I don't know or something like this we're just um yeah you should stop once that far it is  I think is before the um Jesus probably you can we can organize two tables together yeah of course so we just started with an interactive part ners   laptops with you yes okay  this is how we open the   just as you help them  okay so don't lose time because you can also play around if you want to if you want to have something like with his tilde whereas in my case you can have something like it's the same idea you can have something crossed out you use another one you can have it underlined and another one is crossed out and underlined so the same principles so we can play around with this viral later the only thing that I want to show you is that there's also some kind of mathematical environment so it's not a part of there but you can do it like with the dollar signs everything that's surrounded by dollar sign whysoever is basically the mathematical notation so and you could use I don't know if you used latex before to write any mathematical formulas you can just type in Lia formula just an inline formula probably it would look like this so if I compile this as you can see it's a beautifully rendered formula so you can this is you can surround it or have it as a part within your text or paragraph like in this case so and this uses the latte on our case the car tax syntax just try Leah formula and you can use either inline or block so if you add this it will add an so this is wrong because there's some where this so the example is not the right one without backticks but you can like frog one over one minus X and this will generate a larger an entire block by its own within a larger or bigger formula centered within the space but just you don't have to write formulas now it's just that you have an idea so that you can also use beautifully rendered formulas within your document so in this case you just have to look for car tech or latte which uses a similar syntax so just like developed by Donald ichnut  okay so but that would work in any kind of editor so like invite some teams or in Google chat or whatever and this one no I think it's not it's some part of the dollar notation is now also in Kitsap so it was not previously a part of their markdown syntax but it's something like a common use case or practice so some some started with a dollar sign for formulas and embedded this stuff and the other markdown interpreters and editors just build up on this idea and reuse this idea so it's pretty easy and yeah so the next one you can have a look at it just if you want to highlight something like this you have probably seen this from if I'm too fast to you just say stop or what do you mean there's block quotes or this previous  yeah ah I just want this was I mentioned this earlier if you want to get a general help you can type Leah and you can just like type Leah formula and then go to inline blog it shows an example that works probably and it just adds a basic step of a formula so you can change this so but the the uh for formula blocks it adds a too many so but this is something that we change within the editor so there's just this backslash too much you just have to remove uh all know the backslash and if it works we get another formula or something like this so but this is just like mathematical latte style something like this so it's so you can use and actually as I mentioned if you need some help Leah text bold italic uh bull 2 or something like this you can add it like this to get your stuff and you can yeah change it so basically you don't have to remember it but if you've seen this three or four times it's easy to remember so yeah another one is and this is the ideas taken from emails I just like blog quotes if you want to highlight a specific part of your it can be a paragraph it could be something else you simply add those larger or smaller signs or triangles before on this so this is if you refer to another email that's referring to another email it adds automatically these uh dashes so you can create a new  you can add another one so it's also separated by a empty space test so this will be another block quote and whatever we've learned so far you can add those pieces you can have with this bold text into it uh underscore and bold it works so far it works pretty good and if you add this to the other one so this will be again one block right so it will be added to the next paragraph and you're new Now using the same principles if I want to have this as a another block or something like this I just not an empty space but just like an okay this is a block and then there is an empty space or an empty line so and if you want to do this you can also Nest those so now we have a Blog quote within a Blog quote so again this markdown idea like with a bold and the indentation bullet point list also you can access this in within here or we can create a bullet point list if we want to but instead of uh you can create as many as you can so it's the basic idea it might look a bit complicated probably not that beautiful depends on what you want to have on your outcome but it's practice practically the the yeah idea everything that you have learned we'll use the markdown nested repeated reuse it copy and paste it and that's it so the idea of these blog posts is okay clear so the next part is uh references so you can either if you want to refer to another an external URL or something like this or to another image also you can once do this just by copy and paste the entire URL and the markdown interpretable interpreters oh this is the HTTP this is a standalone URL so you can refer like in this to our documentation which is also hosted on GitHub if you click onto this so this will open just a blank documentation so if you can also refer to this if you want to it but it's mentioned within the additional contents but then there is the other one you see this one is not interpreted so it's in the code environment but the basic notation for I want to have a named link so now without back ticks it's just like you give it a name this could be anything and in Brackets and in parentheses you put the URL actually so as you can see I'll increase this a bit so we went from the code block if I recompile this you get a simple little link which refers to the same uh that I made a mistake uh the car URL playground it's the wrong one but I'll copy and paste this one so that's referring to the same documents you can give it another name for example a script of course 23. so this one now again showing to the referring to the documentation and if you've done it before if you want to highlight this link for example you can either I want a space between the name and the link no there is no space allowed from bringing me the same enable day the name and then together with the URL you have to remove the backticks so there's just otherwise and so you can also style the content Within with everything that you've used so far you can highlight this make it bold or there's another one for making a superscript or something like this so yeah within the link or you can surround this probably also I want to have the entire Link in bold so uh do it like in this so you see and again so every piece in marketing is combinable with every piece so it's just like it doesn't look as Beauty as it is or as as beautiful but it just again the idea you can freely combine any formatting to any uh words paragraphs and this and so what is now probably missing  so this could be also like Google  so it's now pointing to Google open it like this but another thing that you might want to if you have one document right and you want to refer to another piece or to another section within your document right so probably within the links I want to refer to the next section which is called images so how do I do this with the internal links you don't use this HTTP and before you use like this hashtag and header and then it's just like uh images the title of your of the slide actually so I change this back to go to images so it changed and when I click onto this internal URL so it will switch to the images right and it could be also like like we'll use tables go to simply rename it tables so it's actually doesn't care if you using like es some uppercase it's just interpreters in the lowercase go to tables so there's another link and we can go to either tables  go back or go to the image section so and this is yeah it's just the next one so repeat how you went on the images from that from that I just go to images and this will refer you don't refer to a URL you refer to the you can like then the header images or the section that's called images so and because we use this as our title uh if I change then the image for example I put a job yeah it won't find it yeah yeah drawing but there's other but this is not standard markdown but in Leo script because we are using numbers for sections I could use this drawing so go to images won't work it will just jump to the first one because there's nothing is found but you can always do you can also use this as the ninth section or something if you start by the first section it's a second you can do this the same and then if I go to images it will yeah go to drawings so these are two basic ways but the images go to some nice place so this is just the title that you want to give it within the document So within the link but where it points to it's just what's within the parentheses so it could be anything it could be probably if you want to put in a video into it it would be uh already had some information about the page number in the data sheet so they have a very easy access um okay so you can do this tasks by your own try to highlight your links probably if you want to or experiments with different formattings and I would like to go so it's written out there just the title without spaces and the other one is so I change this to drawing so the thing is if we want to embed an image for example of this Wikipedia image so I add this as a link probably also give it a name if I click onto it it will send me to this image right just like a link to an image to an external reference or whatsoever and then the inventors of markdown added as something like this piece of this link actually if there's an image included and you want to embed this into your document this should be an important piece of code or important reference you just add an exclamation mark in front of it so we have a link that points to an image and you want to embed this you add an exclamation mark in front of it and it will embed the image where it is so this is the markdown notation for including images just like an extension of this a link idea or reference and you have to think probably I don't have to name them probably so just because it's not shown actually right so I don't give it a name or something like this so it's not important or you might say it's not important right yeah yeah this is uh the idea that I want to point Institute now this text piece of text is actually used it's not only for you uh to remember what's the point of the content mark down logo but this will used as an alt text so if the image is wrong for example or it's moved or you have not a valid internet connection to load this this will load actually this or display this name so there's something broken but this alt text as you might call it is also used by screen readers so if you add some piece of an image or view or whatever it is an embed it you'll probably have a just add a short information what is what is visible on this image so this is might be not useful for you but for those people who use the screen readers server it's displayed in there for them so far so the idea was uh and so what you can also do o do you think so this is the wrong URL or something happens with the image if you can add this additional titles like in quotes this is logo probably not the best description so in Leah script this will be visible as an uh description yeah caption right if I remove this hold it just like a link can you see this this will highlight as a title and actually solve it with more information to the link so in this case but in layerscript we just simply reuse this as an title and if you can go to video probably  it's beautiful probably don't know what this is if I want to embed such another this image probably a large size so it's way too big right so I copy the URL of this image go back to my way to fold your script if I had this URL I want to embed this picture whatever it is you see markdown is pretty small if the picture is too big for the screen these script will automatically render it for you if it's uh or to put it to the right space it will check out what what are the dimensions of the image actually and we'll place it accordingly if you increase it 'll probably so we'll check if the I would say the dimensions on the dimensions though ratio still works so that it's fully visible actually and decided so it will not increase this to a full size because not the entire picture is visible but if you're interested in certain details of your picture you can always click onto it and it will increase so this Zoom image if you add another large image that's too large you will have this zooming functionality additionally is working just yeah inspect some certain parts of the image or visit the entire image so this is just automatically included so and last part of yeah yeah this is not possible in markdown unfortunately but you can either use HTML if you want to to import an image but we added another possibility so this is an HTML comments this will be not visible into within a markdown document it's just not interpreted but you can use something like yeah it's not a beautiful solution but you can like an HTML use any kind of styling so I can use something like with probably like 300 pixels oops so I won't add this to the block so like in this case so I'm sorry and you can or you make it like 100 percent but you define a Max with of 400 pixels or centimeters or depending on what is so it will shrink depending or increase the size depending of the uh yeah the screen resolution that you are using to it otherwise it will stop it's just like but this is actually something it's nice to have but yeah you can can use it if you want you can restyle everything just but we won't go that deep into this for the moment so IL how you I just sorry you mean how important how are you able to put the logo like the pictures the images to get there so this is the alt text or the name in this case of the image then there is in parentheses the URL of the image and then there is like the subtitle caption that you give to the image again and the difference is this is a link and exclamation mark this is uh referring to an other resource but I want to embed this so I can copy this also into the to here so you can try so this is just a basic difference a name on all the information the URL and this is title is actually optional urls needs and if you have within your project but not that's not working within the live editor you just can refer to you skip this part but relative to my URL there is an image folder or the image is called like this and you don't add some HTTP or something to it just uh reference to the local you want to embed this well so there's an electrical guitar look at this I just try to the image so alt text leave it as this I'll remove the image URL and place your url into this and there's the image of the guitar so we had some caption and yeah place this back to the all right so in the last part and then we are done with markdown so but this is probably nice and then we're doing this multimedia stuff the layers group specific issues tables so if you want to define a table in markdown that's actually quite well I don't know an easier way for doing this you see it's just like as you write this down this is the structure of your table and this is rendered accordingly so just like the first line is just the head of the table and in the second line you just Define those the oil you can say the orientation so if I want to have it's the orientation is left handed or something like this by default but if you add those colons on both sides it will be centered and if you adjust the colon to the right side it will put be put on the right so you can also add this colon on the other side and so it will be shown in the other way on other right and it doesn't care about the if there's some table it's not beautifully displayed actually so it doesn't make a change we are so this is just the markdown table you can add as many options as you want to simply copy and paste this so we have a double the table so in layerscript you can also yeah there's a nice little feature to have you can just like sort this your table accordingly but what we also did so was the idea if you have a table it's in some cases might be representing some kind of data right so if I had some numbers or something like to it so in this case it doesn't read any numbers so you can add just add some spaces to it so it will interpret this try to find out okay there's a number so because it's it just parses some part of the rows actually and then it will try to display based on this data what might be the appropriate visualization for this type of data so there's no values in here but only there so probably this might be something like a group and the easiest way to represent this okay amount of dollars or something is like in a bar chart so this is one way if you go to the Leah script documentation um the script.io there is this link to the documentation which is a self-explaining Leah script course hopefully let's search for tables so you can see this table is rendered as a some line chart box spot we had the Box spot already this one is a pie chart if you want to have it like this if you look at the code I simply go to the raw file  s actually it does nothing more as interpretose specific pieces or this table that you have into it just like this might be a line chart actually and then presenting it in the same way uh this might be a bar chart because the first one does not have any data it might be groups concerned to the depending on the weight kilogram and lifespan but what you can also do is probably like pie chart would be just a one liner of a table so there's just like one group and how could I organize this but you can also overwrite the Styles I want to have my data and this probably visualization and there is what's interesting so you can I want to have as a data type as a heat map so I'd simply copy and paste this you can try this out within your editor where is mine so I'll switch I'll change this table into another one or decrease the so it's more visible like in this and you get something like heat map which you can inspect organize filter it's directly shown you can go back to the values reorganize them according to don't know the temperature in November the appearance of the heat map changes so you can just like play around with your data you provide your the actual data of your measurements and the visualization is generated automatically it's not that you get a picture where they actually data is lost afterwards so all the people see is the image which might look quite nice but
the data I want to play around or experiment with is is lost and this is a way just to automatically probably identify a nice visualization for your data so just uh and we ask them to find an appropriate diagram style to illustrate the major contribution of the data outcomes and explained this hybrid group presentation tabular structure hence close to each other it's not necessary the diagram that cannot be many provided interactive exploration tools for the device yeah this kind the data looks a bit different but it's like a matrix with a different points mapped to the ABC ABC and this can be probably represented as a relation graph or something like this so we are now I think we can make a break right so this was a markdown part I hope it's not uh too much but that you can just always have a look at the course that you have created now just change it and experiment with this and in the next section we will add some layer script specific features like we were working with multimedia data quizzes just to name a few we'll show this how to get surveys and at the end how you can make your presentation actually like a narrative presentation so how to add if you've seen it at the beginning how you can add those spoken out text which part should be visible at what animation step and this is actually then the the script part after the lunch and then we will make a introduction to the GitHub can you get more professional with uh another editor on the GitHub platform and what this version management actually brings to you what benefits it has if you cooperate with multiple Auto authors probably and to organize your educational content yeah questions yeah questions so far what are the elements yes just in general is a kind no there is no actually every markdown of this script is like a superset of markdown so every markdown piece is also a valid via script code but Leah script just reinterprets some stuff a bit differently so Mark so in the base is it's always marked down if you can write plane markdown it should be visualized as a also really a script course but if you want to add specifically a script features like quizzes or text-to-speech output this would be readable within the markdown document but it won't display it in the same way also the nice example are the step your instructors this is a traditional markdown tabular presentation and if you switch please do the table what do you mean no to the table in the runner version that's a opportunity of markdown it provides a well not very nice techno structure but that's all as enroll already explained we added many features to this table structure it's not just a representation it allows for instance sorting values it allows to represent the information in the different types of diagrams to adapt quantity to add additional information there are many opportunities on your documentation to include annotations additional setups and if these parameters but we would like to avoid to go into the detail means we have a basic idea of Markham extended this video script to have a better learning experience to explore data sets in different ways so but if you're using Moodle probably you can use the same syntax that you've learned so far with markdown and just open the markdown editor and write in your content sections add links to your local documents add images tables blog codes this is the same syntax as in your model markdown editor or has a lot of other editing software in some parts also in WhatsApp have you as you have seen it yep thank you so much thank you for your support I was just trying to find out a music teacher a music teacher then you have missed the introduction music symbols because we use a lot of symbols yeah science and symbols for musical I have to import them from somewhere so then we will get out so we have like different organizations for our content and one is like Leah 10 late GitHub template my personal uh project are stored on GitHub slash Andre Minos Dietrich so and this is like a templates so when we add some kind so this is what we will learn within the next section on the next part and there we have this ABC notation so probably a few heard of this yeah and  um yeah so if you have a specific library in mind that's not already included we can create a new library that implements or Imports those specific symbols so we did the same probably for the ABC notation so ABC is not part of the standard Leah script syntax but we have this self-explaining course as we hope to so you can it explains how to add this functionality that's imported added in here so we will do this afterwards and we'll show you but this is just like this document is an entire self-explaining course about the functionality and if you want to use this ABC annotation you can open this from within here so it will Point only to this markdown document so Leah script course slash question mark the markdown document and then you can use something like this one so this is the code yeah so if you add this to your markdown after you have imported this you will generate something like this and you can make it also  playable so and you can uh add some additional features if you want to play around with it or you can I showed this earlier so you can make editable codes so in this ABC notation yeah so it's a bit complicated I don't know what it means actually but as we did it before you can edit this I just re-execute this the code somehow changes I don't know what yeah what the notes is but if you yeah so this is actually yeah there are some similar to our programming courses so we are able to develop new pieces of code or pieces of music business student company they are much closer to the material than in nature there are also some like in where was it chemistry or I don't know what it was called a little bit uh probably I don't know this might be interesting this is the same course or importantly describes of course it's not visible in here but no I didn't add this just an example we will address in the afternoon we present some plugins provided by this unit so the traditional form is a diagram table piece of code or something like other health cover has many lecture contents but in many cases the teachers need some specific elements that should be integrated and so one of them are hierarchy hybrids representation obviously course some from the chemistry our chemistry Department asked for a model for atoms and molecules or visualizing their structure and aspects the templates it's just wait a second mermaid a little posters periodic table no is it periodic table yeah particularly this was a chemical extension where can just write formulas or molecules within this structure and then if everything works well it is a big pixel you can actually create use this entire to create this one but also to create a so this is the code above for a three-dimensional structure so you can only code I don't know so you can like ads for programming or for other purposes like those features if there's a library available or service somewhere within the internet we can add this or make a template a library that you can import multiple times within your courses different courses you don't have to re-implement this by your own and you can reuse this functionality thank you I am perfect so I used my brief question is can we use this background to write it as a different basically I I know that markdown actually is used also there are different because you can say dialects and I a colleague of us is also such a markdown Enthusiast that he wrote also his thesis with markdown but then probably not with I don't know Leah script is the right choice it's more uh the ideas more to have online courses not probably not the dissertation but it depends I mean just like if it's too much text it will display it too but I don't know it might be complicated content in lockdown and transfers the result afterwards to Latin and to avoid thinking about certain annotations specific commands and and afterwards actually finished meaningful works then we switch to a nice looking PDFs based on logic this is just like the markdown of the standard so there are other pandok or other standards where you can translate your markdown documents into something else into Word documents like yeah functionalities as a specific small tool that provides or PDFs and it is  thank you okay
great welcome to those of you who are just joining us right now as you can see in the screen we will be starting the webinar soon at the top of the hour we already have over 25 people in the room here with us welcome to all of you it's lovely to have you with us for our e-learning in dhaba for july 2022 my name is elan i'll be your host today and in a moment at the top of the hour in about two minutes time we will be introducing our panel of speakers we have some exciting speakers to talk about some extremely interesting topics in the world of e-learning and what i'd like to invite everyone to do at the stage is to type into the chat where you're dialing in from i know that there are many people dialing in from all over the world not just in south africa of course this uh e-learning in daba has been hosted by new leaf here in south africa but we have many many international participants or people attending so love to hear where you're all dialing in from and you can just use the chat button at the bottom and let us know where you are we have almost 50 people in the room with us right now and we'll be starting in just about a minute if you're just joining us welcome to you uh yeah we are recording the session so you know too and uh this will be uh recording directly to the cloud there will be an opportunity for you to get hold of that recording at a later stage so we have about 60 people in the room with us right now it is the top of the hour and i think we are almost ready to get started it looks like we want to make sure that everyone can now chat with everyone so we'd love to ask you all as we start off with our opening video over here welcome everybody we want to invite you all to type into the chat where are you all dialing in from i see it's now enabled and we've seen people dialing in here from south africa namibia cape town oh good old swag month pretoria krugerstorp and those of you who are dying in from overseas we'd love to hear where you are also looks like we're hitting all nine of the provinces in south africa over here as well as i'm sure some people dining in from overseas welcome this is our july edition of the e-learning in daba we have been conducting a few of these webinars throughout the year we even had a hybrid one uh last month i think it was a month or two ago and for those of you who were able to join us we were glad to see you in the flesh and lovely to see that everyone is dialing in here and typing into the chat where they are calling in from it is just a minute past the hour and what i'd like to do is just go through some housekeeping of course you will be muted most of the time in this webinar and you can communicate with us in one of two ways first of all uh you already are many of you are already using the chat uh and that is found at the bottom of your screen if it's not activated on the right hand side of your screen you'll see it down at the bottom just click on the chat icon and you can communicate with us let us know some comments what's connecting with you what's resonating with you and we would love to hear uh how you're enjoying some of the speakers presentations there is also a q and a button at the bottom the q a button is where you can type in some questions we will be having two q a sessions the first one we're about to kick off with in just a short while and then there will be one towards the end so if you have any questions you want to make sure that you type it into the q a pod at the bottom of the screen it will pop up on the side and you'll be able to type your question in we will assign that to whoever is going to answer that for you hopefully live or otherwise if not live then they will reach out to you directly to answer that question so we have got four panelists with us today i'd like to introduce the first of those two to you and i'm actually going to stop the share over here of this video and invite them to come onto camera right now and that would be mike hanley and paul hanley now for those of you who don't know paul hanley is the founder of new leaf technologies uh michael hanley his uh his son who is also the managing director of the company both based out of johannesburg south africa wonderful uh experts in the world of e-learning and uh what i'd like to do is open up as i bring you on to sort of center stage over here for everyone to see paul and mike and i will uh ask some questions of you from the audience over here so that's essentially what we would like to do and i see that i think we already have our first question that may have popped up into uh that was just some comments over here thank you very much we did enable the chat right now and that is all working perfectly so what i'd like to invite you to do is begin by asking any specific questions that you may have these can be general they can be related to anything in the e-learning industry and i think we're going to have a short discussion about that right now where both paul and mike have got an extensive amount of experience not just here in south africa but working in the e-learning industry around the world so we would like to have a couple of questions come up right now and see what uh if you have anything specifically that you would like to ask and while we wait for that we will maybe start with a first one on my side that that uh was actually emailed before the session even began and mike i'd like to uh maybe direct this to you uh the this really relates to the whole work from home route and uh the question is with everyone getting used to work from home how do you see things like onboarding and induction being influenced by technology what are some of the challenges that you are seeing there at new leaf thanks elaine and welcome to everyone um it's good to have you here at another e-learning in darba so we've certainly seen a massive influx of inquiries and we've been helping a lot of entities develop you know onboarding experiences and i think you know as an employer you want to cultivate an environment that unlocks a new hire's potential faster and getting a newbie up to speed quickly is certainly quite easy and achievable if you've got the right process in place and if you continue to sort of monitor that process and make adjustments where needed in order to improve that onboarding experience cycle so you know in today's recruitment cycles it's becoming increasingly harder to effectively induct new hires remotely while bridging the gap uh you know from to productive performance and especially where time is off essence and you know different roles require different onboarding experiences depending on the job function you know if internal sops and procedures and processes are mapped out badly it can take a lot longer from a time frame perspective depending on that new hire's ability to sort of ascertain an understanding of their function of their role and of their employees expectation and i think you know a lot of what we see and and one way to sort of practically guarantee failure is to hand in a newbie a pile of forms and manuals and start an orientation video in the office and and then just leave them be you know let them sort of pick their noses so to speak on their own because i think when you come back you'll probably find them surrounded by a couple of biscuit crumbs and a vague look of i've lost interest in this but you know when you've done it right employee onboarding is is really impactful it's an impactful process that can improve employee retention you know shorten that time to competency and increase performance rapidly so i think you know a couple of things to sort of keep in mind there is just making sure that new hires have a very clear first impression of the culture and the work environment make sure employees meet and understand the roles of hr direct line managers their key co-workers and their immediate team and making sure that they understand their job duties and the com company policies and procedures comprehensively and develop skills that are immediately put to use you know with relatable job tasks that allow for time to practice and it helps to sort of present an infographic on on you know the steps that employees should take and what they need to accomplish sets and some milestones and some goals um so that as they go through that new hiring process they sort of presented with a timeline um that that sort of maps up to that that onboarding experience i'll tell you a story about how we recently helped a a very large entity over in dublin um called icon they are a medical research facility they employ about 55 000 people worldwide so it's a multinational loads of different languages and backgrounds and loads of different learning styles and you know it was our task to help them change the way they onboard their new staff and it was quite a challenge it was one that we were definitely up for and one that we really enjoyed it was a good experience but we created we created something quite meaningful and impactful and immersive so you know depending on where that new hire was joining they had a very tailored specific experience to their role and to the region that they worked in um and you know got to go through sort of virtual office tours and things like that we did attach some cultural components that helped the learners traverse through that training experience so you know the concept that we came up with was that we really wanted to embed that that employee that new hire into the team you know into the business so that they become functional and productive so what we came up with was a bit of a mechanism on the gamification side where we came up with a concept of throughout the learning experience learners had to be presented with challenges and different activities where they could sort of get a lens on uh the types of things that they'd be doing and if they get it right they would collect molecules now obviously within medical research that's quite relevant and as they collected all these molecules that was how they sort of unlocked different experiences as they traversed that sort of ended up as a result um you know that sort of award there was that they became part of the icon dna um and the simplicity there was you know it kept the learner engagement high at the end that dna sort of reward was then attached to their email signatures so there was no real monetary reward at all but it just was a bit of a stamp of approval on their email signatures and when they sort of did you know communication between their colleagues between different regions they started seeing all of these little steps of dna coming apart and that sort of presented quite a nice experience for some of the old employees to ask questions and go you know what's this that's quite interesting that's quite exciting and we even started to see some of the guys that have been there for 20 years wanting to be reinducted into the business so it was quite a good exercise and it was a good success we got a lot of engagement and a very high completion rate and you know what it freed up their facilitators their staff who were not being productive with the amount of face-to-face facilitation and virtual facilitation for onboarding and you can imagine an entity that size and that diverse in multiple different regions it was quite a tough challenge but we definitely hit the mark there um yeah that's so that's exciting mike it was good fun yeah there was um i mean the influx has been enormous i think a lot of companies are struggling with this and it's a really important thing to get right you know it's you've only got a once off chance to really inspire a new joiner and you know if you look at attrition rates and things like that you want to attract and retain talent and these days it's tough to do so especially with this digital nomadicy and you really want to make that that impression right up front and i think you know some of the the normal challenges are you know access to an email access to the relevant software arriving at work on day one and you know not being presented with a goodie bag or a laptop you know all of that sort of stuff happens in the back end and and sometimes it's delayed and you know there's always loads of reasons for these things but you only have that one impression and and you've got to make it right the first time [Music] michael and paul we we're getting some more questions coming through here in the q a part over here and mike i love that story about uh icon in dublin and what you've been able to do with them through the use of your all your resources and gamification i think it's a it makes a beautiful case study for how as you said we have that one opportunity just one to make that first impression so a couple of other questions for you over here uh we have someone asking when you when you're talking about e-learning does that include blended learning as well yeah i i would say very much so and you know if we look back where we've been over the last few years obviously through covet we had the situation where we went into complete crisis mode every organization pretty much did the same and they used any tool let's pop something online let's let's get by um and really we we've matured now we're going out of the the crisis and businesses are starting to look at more long-term approaches because really of the cost-effectiveness of being able to do it online but blended is is where we seem to be settling down now so the the trick to blended learning is to make sure that the classroom experience is streamlined so make sure that people are classroom ready i mean do that online um being classroom ready means we can shorten the amount of time that you need to spend in the classroom and then of course push them out through assessments and and continuous learning back online again so it's it's definitely uh part of the landscape and it looks to me that's that's where we're going to settle down in future obviously some things are better done in the classroom uh more practical sort of stuff but um the cost effectiveness of blended is is here to stay and i think what's really what we found is people because they've been jumping into all sorts of different tools it's a little bit chaotic so there's been a lot of chaos in the market what we're seeing now is the settling down so more um more intent in the long term so starting to look at systems uh that can accommodate both online and classroom events all through one system that that's going to be very important um and also i think you know really the the fact is because of cost saving we we don't want to go back to where we were so what what coverts done is proved to us that actually online works if we do it properly that's and that's that's the truth paul you've actually said uh touched on the important thing which leads to one of the next questions and i know we have just a limited amount of time for this specific q a panel discussion over here but the good news is that we've got some good questions that we'll address later on too but i think we're opening up a can of worms over here rachelle pillay has asked the question you know you were talking about all these different apps and different things that different tools that are available she would like to know which mobile learning apps or platforms have you found to be the most effective in terms of meeting objectives and why and of course it is a we're opening going down a rabbit hole but maybe this will this will sort of prompt us into the next uh some of the presentations that we have today too mike it's it's a very interesting question that because i think what we have seen in in the market is a saturation of all sorts of tools and nifty little devices and things and really to be honest with you some of these are quite dubious they've popped up the uh it infrastructure is dodgy to say the best they've been cobbled together and there's no substance behind the companies that provide them so we've seen some instances where a lot of time efforts ip's been put into platforms that are there one minute and gone the next so i think it's very important that you know when we start looking at what tools we should be using we do a little bit more research it's not just about price it's about the sustainability of the company in the long term it's about the um you know the fact that there's good solid i.t infrastructure behind it there's good security behind it the other thing i think that's important is being technology it's always shifting so the key is to choose a tool that's going to grow with the market so it's good and well saying finding some sort of cheap platform but if there's no money being spent on it in developing it further in no time at all you're gonna be behind the times so if you take a product and we've got two two of the best ones in the world uh with both epignosis and a new spring here but if you look at that they spend a considerable amount of the income on continuous development of the product so that's a that's a very important one so it's a matter of doing a little bit of research i think you'll also find that you know if you can find a product that's good good foundation we can now start pulling in different tools into these platforms so you're not locking yourself into a system what you need to do is get a system that will accommodate all sorts of other new tools that come out as well as we can and so your ecosystem can develop that's very good point paul and i i see mike's got something to add to that too and then after that i think we may have to address some of these other questions in our second q a portion at the end but thank you very much and i would invite all of you to continue to type questions as and when they pop into your head mike once you've finished answering that question sure um well thanks rachelle for the question i think it's a bit like you know choosing the right tool for the application so you know if you've got certain objectives that need to be mapped you've got to know your learning demographic and the learning styles that you know maybe your learners are most going to be utilizing so you're not going to sort of use a hammer to try and make a hole in a piece of wood you're going to use a saw so you know it's about identifying what functional requirements will make sense and will make the most impact and there's loads of good tools as paul was talking about i think the the trick there is you know just to give it a bit of insight and to think about it and almost look at what's a successful implementation or solution would be and work backwards you know what what is going to make the most impact for you and then try and source the product or the the tool but don't use the wrong tool just because it's cheap um it's not going to be always that effective so yep i think we're picking up from both of you is that price is not necessary it's an important factor but it's not the only factor certainly and there's many many more things to consider but thank you very much to both of you paul and mike that's uh excellent i'm going to take all of us off of stage over here right now and it's i think it's an opportunity for us to move to the next presenter uh this is a panelist who may be familiar to some of you and here he comes on camera he is based in the netherlands there in his offices beautiful to see you stefan fundatol let me tell you a little bit about stefan before he gives us his presentation stefan is the chief customer officer or cco at a new spring and during his 15 plus years of experience in the technology and learning industry he was lucky enough to help hundreds of customers become successful with learning technology now stefan is passionate about customer success learning nature and running and he will now tell you a little story called what kelly told laura so stefan it's great great to have you with us and we'd like to hand over to you thanks for that um as i said i guess you're able to see my screen right now just a quick check yes we can perfectly thank you great um yeah well this story i'm going to tell you about what kelly told laura actually kind of aligns with the discussion we just heard with michael and paul based on the question from rachelle so um happy to tell you all about it um hi from the netherlands again i'm stefan i'm gonna tell you about what kelly told laura and um this story is about laura mainly so this is laura hi laura lori laura is a learning designer at atc awesome training company she's happy in her job and just finished up a quite thorough selection of a learning platform she walked through this process together with will wills the ceo of awesome training company and a few months back laura and will decided to rewrite the company vision on learning the world was changing rapidly and they wanted to stay up front and make sure that they can handle future challenges so that's what they did they talked to people in the company they organized inspirational talks and came to a three-pager that shows the vision of learning at adc after that it was time to make this vision happen there was a lot to be started up one of those things was that they needed new tooling as paul and michael hall already discussed they in particular needed a learning platform to make that part of their vision come to life and they truly believe in a blended approach to learning and needed a platform that helps people learn so they started the tool selection they selected the top three and after trying it out and giving it a good thought they decided to choose the tool they needed in order to make their dreams come true and that's where we are now laura made this big decision she's happy with the fact that she did so and she should be but she knows that this is just the beginning the road towards huge success is not a straight line and it's definitely not easy laura doesn't want to mess up and she decides to call kelly she's known kelly from a previous job and kelly has been implementing learning platforms for quite some years apart from the fact that kelly is happy to speak with lara she almost immediately tells laura that this vision its huge success is important but it can also be paralyzing to have such a big audacious goal because to be honest do you know exactly what that huge success looks like it's it's kind of hard right it's something in your head but you can't really define it so let's just not think about huge success here i like to speak about desired outcome since laura will and their colleagues have been spending quite some time on working out their vision and learning they should be able to derive the desired outcome from that three major the desired outcome is the ultimate goal for your learning platform implementation building a learning journey or a course in itself is almost never the goal that learning journey should lead to something an outcome it's a means to an end and that angle that desired outcome is something you should always keep in mind and work too much to when implementing your learning platform some examples can be seen here the first one our full training portfolio is available as blended learning at the end of 2022 that could be a desired outcome or we want to personalize all our online training to upgrade the success rate of our training with 20 and you can have multiple desired outcomes you just have to make sure that they're measurable and on measuring i'll get back on that later the thing is these goals are or can be huge and it doesn't always help in getting your first step down so that's why i suggest to define your first value your first value is a relatively small goal with a clear scope that's totally aligned with your desired app by defining the first value you create a concrete success milestone towards your desired outcome some examples of those first values are often the use cases of the platform that you were already in your head like uh transform my offline classroom training to a blended learning module and connect two of my customers or enroll 20 learners in my pilot e-learning course on it security by december 2022 by defining your first value you set yourself up for a success milestone in the near future but hey laura i know you see me as your smart friend but i don't want to take too much of your time is this helping in any way yes i want more is what lara said okay then here we go and i have to be honest here kelly took a lot of inspiration from the new spring success framework this is a seven step framework to make sure you become successful with your learning platform and i will just share the story kelly told laura the first one we kind of already addressed it's defining your ultimate goal your desired outcome and defining the first step the first value the first success milestone towards your desired outcome there are some tips and tricks on defining those and i'll be sure to share them after this presentation as well how to get those goals ready how to formulate them in a smart way i'll get back to it after this presentation the second step is the implementation map switching to a blended learning solution can have quite an impact your internal processes need to be reconsidered and together all your stakeholders it demands time investments from you and potentially your colleagues and before you start it's important to think about those conditions this gives you insight in your available resources resources and realistic planning think about your didactical model the way you create content or how you keep your stakeholders connected make sure to always keep your desired outcome top of mind they together with your first value are guiding light in this implementation the implementation map uses checklists that result in actions as you can see right here um some could be quite obvious some could dig a little deeper the most important thing that everything that you're doing is aligned to your measures how are you going to evaluate your courses at the end and when will this be a success like addressed earlier on that you success you have to make it measurable after thinking about these and more questions you have clarity on what's needed from your organization to make this a successful journey as you can already see here in step 7 of the success framework we will be sure to measure these goals okay we've discussed the desired outcome first value in this third step we will create a learning design filled with learning activities and content that contributes to achieving your first value as said designing and building the learning journey should not be the goal it should fill in the learning objectives the results and actions from your implementation map will help you to create an impact on learning design who is your target audience where you create a blended learning journey what learning activities will you use those questions that were already asked you in the implementation map and what you thought of you can use the answers to get to your learning design then step four it's time to get your hands dirty and build your learning tune you will use the learning journey design that you created in step three design building your learning journey and all the content in it can be quite challenging you got a audience right here that can probably uh tell us that that's the case it's a creative process and you can make it as fancy as you want you can get really creative but the most important thing is to align your content with your learning objectives this might be the most important tip we can give you in this step apart from that this in most cases is also the step where you really have to do the work i'm a big fan of jerry seinfeld jerry appeared in the tim ferriss podcast for people who don't know jerry seinfeld is a very successful comedian he's been a comedian for decades and you might expect that being the creative guy he is uh he just thinks about those jokes in coffee bars works them out on his phone gets along with the talk he's having and so on he's just strolling around through life and coming up with those great ideas as a matter of fact jerry is totally into systemizing your life in order to get what you want if you if he would hire a billboard with an inspirational text on it it would say just work well why am i telling you this the phase design and build are phases where you really have to do the work you have to set yourself up for success here like jerry does block those two hours in the morning look at the blank course material and start don't let yourself get distracted get back in it and also reward yourself actually stop after those two hours he did it well done you did what you wanted to do and that's a treat in itself well i just i just love it it's such a creative guy but such a pragmatic approach okay after that build step we're going to step five we've already mentioned testing your course before launching make sure to do a final check walk through your course are your learning objectives addressed by the learning activities you have built are there still any open concerns looking at your implementation map are all stakeholders on board ask yourself these questions before you head over to step six there we go it's a great feeling to launch of course and enroll your first learners those learners will dive into the content you designed but learning doesn't always happen by itself sometimes it needs a bit of guidance and help to come to fruition and in some cases be sure to track the process attract the progress anticipate on your learner's knowledge gaps and communicate with your learners that could be a vital step in making sure this course reaches its goals and then we've come to the final step of the success framework we've almost arrived at our first value and it's now important to see how this learning journey affected your first value and in the end your desired outcomes of course this will be so much easier when you define smart desired outcomes and first values what you did in step one and two smart goals like ninety percent knowledge retention or ninety first five percent of participants achieve their certificate can easily be checked off be sure to get really clinical on defining these goals in order to know what impact you're making on the learners and your company as said we will share some more info on this after this presentation okay getting back to laura and kelly this pretty much sums up the story kelly told laura laura being laura wanted to sum up her key takeaways just to be sure she understood well these are the key takeaways lara took from the story kelly told laura write down your desired outcomes but focus on the milestones like the first version building learning journeys is awesome and i can really relate but you have to do the work building learning journeys is not a goal define learning objectives and measure learning impact it might be the most important tip we see this happening a lot that it's seen as a goal in itself i really would like to make sure that we're actually measuring the impact we're making that sums up the story from my end i would really like to thank you for listening uh i don't know elon if we have time for some questions right now if that's the case we can do that i know there's time from 11 to 11 15. in the meantime as said i'll share the link to more information on how the success framework can help you out but yeah that's my story for now wonderful thank you so much stefan very interesting and i love the story uh that you told there uh and uh really thought provoking for i think for everyone and we'd love to hear your thoughts on what you heard from stefan and what's sort of resonating with you please feel free to type into the chat which you will find either at the bottom or on the bottom right of your screen over there so uh i think what we'll do stefan if you don't mind we'll move on to to christos our next panelist next presenter and then what we will do is have an opportunity to ask any questions and again we'll ask everybody that has any questions to use the q a pod to type in anything over there would that be all right with you stefan that's awesome thanks for listening and i'll see you in a bit excellent thank you so much and uh at this stage i'd like to introduce you to our next panelist who is christos matthiopoulos he is from a company called epignosis uh this is a company he heads up uh the new york team in the united states although today he's dialing in from athens in greece uh and uh let me tell you a little bit about chris he is the head of international uh alliances for san francisco based epignosis and he'
 going to reveal how to find the right learning technology and the right partner for your business epignosis already works with companies like ebay pwc and philips and they own the e-front and talent lms brands so with that chris i'd like to welcome you to the panel over here and please uh take it away thank you so much helen um and hello everyone my name is christopher theopoulos and it's a real pleasure to be with you all today i i as ilon mentioned i head up partnerships and alliances that's a prognosis and i'm really excited today to share a little bit of background with you um about our company and hypnosis uh our learning solutions e-front and tank lms and share some tips and best practices and selecting the right platform and then partner as well so firstly some background about bignesses we are leading technology vendors specializing in e-learning solutions with over 15 years experience our mission is to provide enterprise-ready turnkey solutions that are intuitive with low-touch support and at a price point that can't be matched we have a global footprint with five locations with high year-on-year growth and an expanding team and customer base as you can see here is a is a breakdown of some of our current customer base and you'll see that about 60 are based in north america with uh you know eu following with around 25 percent and then the rest of the world we are vendors in fact of three different learning solutions so first of all we have uh talent lms which is our cloud-based lean lms with a feature set of accounts to make a difference then we have e-front which is our enterprise learning management system with advanced features and flexibility to support pretty much any specific need that a customer may have and e-front one of the main highlights is that it's available as an on-premise solution but also on the cloud and then our third solution is talent cards which is our mobile micro learning solution with dedicated native apps and a web interface to create uh cards and then push them live to those apps so yeah town cars is our latest offering um it's been on the market for close to four years now but um you know it's uh it complements the lms offerings in line with the market trends to um you know for mobile learning now all these three solutions share the same dna uh overall and those are you know to be fully featured full featured solutions high customer satisfaction rates they're cost effective quick time to value and the main focus of these are um you know being easy to use intuitive and um you know supporting self-service so customers can really uh pretty much do everything they need to on their own um and you know make it very easy to use now um as you can see here we have uh multiple awards for our software and uh we take uh customers uh happiness and support very seriously and you can see this from all the various awards all related categories we also have very popular solutions with over 11 000 customers at the moment and you can see some of the main some of the logos here and some of our customer names okay so now i um now just very quickly i want to look at some of the highlights of our learning solutions so we can set the scene to then explore how to actually select uh the right platform and partner um so you can see some of the main things uh to look out for but also you know to not get confused on uh because there's a lot of information out there each vendor will try to show various pieces of information so yeah i just want to give you some highlights and then we'll look at some of the details on how to select the right uh learning platform in partner so first of all e-front um e-front is a it's a learning management system that is geared towards businesses uh with scalability extensibility security and advanced customization requirements in mind this is um this is uh you know mainly for organization you know larger organizations amid larger organizations and it is in fact um our first offering so efrain started off um was first started offering e-friends over 15 years ago now but of course since then it has uh been completely rewritten from scratch two times uh in line with the latest um you know web trends and technologies now e-front we have uh three main use cases um so as you can see and uh so first of all we have um uh employee training so this could be anything from uh candidate screening to induction training or continuous development performance appraisals then we have uh compliance training so you know you can use the front to support uh compliance training on laws regulations or various company policies and and then of course the third is extended enterprise so this is where you would um you know be able to deliver training to external customers or partners or external collaborators and um you know to support any particular training needs they have now although these are  the main different use cases obviously many of our customers combine all three uh and can do so under the single e-front portal now what makes e-front unique uh we have uh a lot of um you know some of the highlights here so flexible deployment so this is available as an on-premise solution or on a cloud we have various customization options extensive security options and hundreds of integrations and advanced uh lms features so as i said yeah we have um the self-hosted option but also the private cloud this um you know the self-hosted is very important for larger organizations with very strict uh data and privacy security processes um and so yeah they often opt for self-hosted which there are you know only a handful of offerings on the market so this is something that makes e-funds super unique then um so in terms of uh the customizability of the front the you know we have various um options here allowing efron to support you know various complex training structures and organizational hierarchies and you'll see here some of those options so um you know with groups and branches and various skill gaps and still got tests and so on and we're able to support um all these complex training needs so excuse me and then um so yeah we have ephraim has various advanced security settings as well and um you know is is ready with various uh enterprise uh um sso and uh security configuration options in in out of the box and so you know you don't need to do anything um specific for those we have multiple integrations both native and via zapier so all of these can be um you know ethan can then be included in your wider ecosystem very easily and natively and um yeah this comes back to a point that paul mentioned earlier which is very important uh you know being able to have a solution that integrates with you know emerging technologies and as those technologies often change some of the more advanced options here um so yeah we have a skill gap testing knowledge parity assessments gamification engines and so the these will make for you know being able to deliver and support complex training needs of course training on the go is super important nowadays um and uh yeah e-front has um you know very easy to use and comprehensive uh mobile app uh supporting you know a variety of different types of content and so on so learners can access pretty much everything from their app and this these are some of our customers here again some some names and logos you'll be familiar with and just to show you those okay now uh we've had a look at um efron now very quickly talent lms so tantalum s is our leaner lms it's um you know it's designed to be super easy to use um it you know it doesn't do everything under the sun in the moon but what it does it does very well and so it is um flexible to support again various uh needs uh customizable so yeah you can obviously include your own logos and you know white leicester um sorry why label it but um you know you won't be able to do to the extent that you can on each front um obviously with more options come from flexibility complexity so um for that reason we've tried to limit those to any of those that matter for you know the majority of use cases talented ms obviously comes with ready-made courses as well um and and um which is actually called the tanner library um and this is an offering of ready-made forces that we make available to uh with our solutions uh then so why tantalum so it's very uh powerful uh extensible uh you know we have award-winning support that we've received uh you know multiple awards for as very little to zero maintenance required it's all based on the cloud and uh it is um you know very disruptive pricing offering probably one of the best values on the market um in terms of uh learning management systems again so what type of training solutions do we support um you know with uh with tantams you can pretty much do the same as with effront um so you know we have the employee training you have the extended enterprise training and of course then commercial e-learning as well if you want to sell training to those external users a little bit more about talent library so this is something we've been working with an external collaborator with and we have approximately uh 350 courses at the moment and where we add we constantly add to our courses the whole idea is to make these courses engaging and you know try and get uh the message across in the fun and uh in a fun manner to the learners and you know making sure that um you know it's uh relevant to to the youngest generations nowadays and you know we've seen a lot of success a lot of great feedback so far and um yeah we're looking forward to enhancing the library going forward again multiple integrations available with talent lms as well and uh it is available with um you know mobile apps and dedicated mobile apps because yeah this is super important nowadays some of our customers here and again you'll notice some of the logos and um names here okay so how how to select uh the right partner uh sorry the right uh platform so we i tried to show list here some of the main points which you know you need to be consider uh when uh selecting the right platform and you know as we saw from both e-front and tantamous uh you know even though it's built from the same company and you know with the same dna there are various you know significant differences um between the solutions so yeah let's have a look at some specific use cases now and when we would actually recommend these so first of all tantalums is a great fit for first-time lms users you know smes or you know maybe departments branches or particular geographical units within larger organizations um and you know some you know so it's a great stepping stone um to the learning um the learning world but also can support uh you know larger organizations with a very specific project or need then on the other hand we have e-front which is ideal for organizations with uh complex training structures and hierarchies that may need to host on local servers and you know may have also very unique user workflow requirements or you know requires certain features or particular reports a great example of this is a customer ihs market whose main criteria was flexibility to support custom workflows for learners to take a specific security assessment when they first joined this then dynamically allocates training to them based on the user responses and then once the user completes that training they they have to complete an assessment at the end and they then wanted specific reports to compare the you know how the user did at the end compared to the beginning and provide a security rating per country overall which we displayed on a geographical map so this is a very good example of uh you know very specific and quite advanced use case that um you know ephraim was a perfect fit for then for talent lms a great example is deliveroo i'm not sure if you're familiar with this salute with this company in south africa it's very popular in europe um where it's a food tech company uh they deliver their delivery company um and um you know one of the main criteria for them was uh to improve learner engagement and uh they did this with uh talent s um and uh we see some of the key stats on the screen here now so regarding um you know the the right uh you know how to choose the right lms uh you know the as we've seen you know even from from uh the same company we have two different solutions uh you know which are very unique and um you know each catering for a specific need as you as you very well know there's many uh multiple uh learning management systems out there and um you know it can become confusing so you know what what i would uh suggest here is um you know to focus on the right lms for you your stakeholders and your learners you need to focus on getting an lms that does everything you need you know nothing more nothing less and you know i know this sounds obvious and simple but you may you'll be surprised with how many customers actually ask for things that they don't actually need nice to haves just to tick the boxes without actually even needing it and it you know it's in human nature to want more uh and for less but in terms of um you know in lms and many other aspects of life less is more so not only does it make no sense to pay for something that you will not use but the more features available the more complex the system becomes to manage interface implement and the more things that can go wrong so focus on what you need and you know try and keep it simple many organizations and buyers fall into the trap of purchasing an lms based on what takes the most boxes but without actually needing the functionality this just complicates the process and increases the cost and confuses users so gather all stakeholders and clearly identify the requirements to focus on and this will also help with the implementation process okay now the the right lms so from our experience this comes down to five simple rules okay so it's all about it's all about your specific needs so like humans each organization is different and has different needs what we think we need is often different to what we actually need so this is the perceived versus actual requirements turn actual expectations into requirements this is in my view the most critical part to the overall outcome dictating the success from implementation to the quality of training delivered gather a team that reflects all involved stakeholders allow each party to express their expectations but be ruthless when shortly listening into requirements this will ensure that you're left left with the list of actual requirements that will result in an lms solution that will be useful for everyone involved number two we don't live in a matrix in the matrix or maybe we do but whichever the case don't pay too much attention to comparison matrices and checklists comparing lms's an lms having a particular feature is not the same as an lms having a good implementation of that feature or a user user-friendly interface that makes the feature easy to use these checklists become a mental burden and take attention away from the actual goal number three actions speak louder than brochures so of course you need to check the the lms supports your actual use case but take advantage of any you know free demo accounts on offer and you know i would definitely suggest you know testing with the pilot phase um and overall i would be quite suspicious of a vendor that does not offer a free trial so support matters no matter how user-friendly an lms is you will need to have great support talented ms for example is super easy to use and has won multiple rewards for his user friendliness still we have people who have support requests all the time for for some it is because they you know they haven't referred to the knowledge base for others it's because of the first time using an lms i'm not familiar with even the basics but no matter the reason you want to have easy and timely support and the final um point here i want to make is that uh yeah mobile is the new desktop so you know mobile um you know everything is mobile nowadays um and um this includes a large part of corporate training as well being mobile so e-learning is all about freedom and empowerment and being able to complete training wherever you are um you know whenever you want um you know when maybe you're on your way to a client and you just want to refresh yourself with some uh particular information or on your commute to work or at home you know this is what really um you know matters okay and then we have um so i just wanted so now that we've seen you know and i run through how to select the right learning technology i also want to just quickly touch on how to select the right partner so first of all when we say partner um who do we mean um so in terms of um ila any learning partner this is a partner to help you achieve your goals okay so although the need for a partner may differ depending on who you ask for us as a company of bignesses a partner is a company that specializes in offering value-added services around e-learning that can help customers with their learning uh platform this is exactly what the end customer also means as well so our goals are aligned here and we we have partnered with the best local companies like new leaf technologies in south africa that can offer the best value added services to our customers needs but why do you need a partner and this is because vendors like us like a bigness cannot offer the width and depth of services to everything around the world like a local seller can the local reseller can often can offer much more in terms of both a tailored approach to your support requirements assist with implementation and to go undergo any specific custom needs that you may have as well and also as the local partner is closer to you the customer can offer various consultation advice and ensure your learning technology implementation is aligned with your business needs and this leads on to the main um the main reasons here why uh you know what what's a partner can offer um and so these are um yeah some of the main reasons here so aligning your learning goals with your business goals and uh we have a seven-step strategy here which i can share you know after the today's uh session but um you know this is something that a partner can be very helpful with and can consult on how learning goals can help achieve the desired business goals and you know this may be not something very uh that some customers will be comfortable to discuss but it's very important to align these in order to ensure the overall success of your learning program number two to scope requirements to meet the learning goals so this is uh you know something the partner can really be helpful with and you know in many cases having an outsider to the organization come in and you know gather requirements from all stakeholders is vital and you know being able to then shortlist those into actual uh learning goals um for the for the learning program of course the the partner can also offer various uh value-added services to support your learning goals and these can range from the basics so for example local support phone support uh you know on-premise support or implementation assistance to more advanced things like integration systems or you know offering a managed service and um and then the last one would be actual content development so content development is know very important obviously um no matter how good the lms is or the learning platform without content is pretty much useless and so this is where really a local partner can actually be very helpful and assist with content development services such as converting existing content and optimizing it for e-learning assist with uh you know various other specific services around content like scripting or voice-overs or storyboarding and production and overall the the partner can also help make sure you achieve higher engagement with with your learning and you know they have experience with it and uh you know can include you know various um trends uh such as game-based learning and um objectives as well so yeah those were uh the main points uh i wanted to share with you uh with you all today i hope uh i hope that was uh helpful and uh interesting so thank you all for listening thank you very very much chris and uh really appreciate you spending time to share your presentation with all of us here today well everyone we are at the top of the hour right now and i'd like to invite all of our panelists back right now because we are going to have our second q and a portion of our session today of the e-learning in daba for july 2022 and what i'd like to do is address some of these questions mike i think maybe you can help me address uh or direct these questions to who you think would be best to answer these questions i actually have one to start off with with is uh something that richard uh typed into the chat and this is specifically for stefan uh richard has asked you stefan please could you elaborate a bit on what the key critical components one should be aware of during the launch live and measure stages of the system deployment yes i guess i can combine the key the key tips or tricks for launch and live combined and i've seen a lot of customers or not even customers but a lot of cases where there's a lot of time had been spent on building the learning journey on on getting it right on connecting it to the learning objectives but then the launch was just quite fast it there wasn't that much time spent on that i i've seen customers spending 100 plus hours on building a learning journey and then just sending out an automatic generated email with login information to the learner without even one sentence describing what's expected so most important lesson for the step launch in live is to manage expectations and make sure to spend that less time on getting that learning journey across making sure the learner feels safe in the environment knows what the role the instructor is may manage the expectations of the instructor so don't just connect someone as a teacher to a course and expect them to log in and do their job uh just take them with you and and and  yeah get them along to to make sure you reach your goals so manage equity stations for the launch and live phase and on the measure part i would say ask yourself the question is this really the goal and ask that question ten times until you've actually reached the point where what it's at like i said the learning building and learning journey is not the goal almost never the goal as you said the question why am i building this learning what do i want to change what what's and how can that change then be measured and ask that question to your colleagues is this exactly what we want to reach might take half an hour might take a few hours but it's the most important step to really know that you're doing the right thing thank you stefan i think that's a perfectly perfectly uh encompassing answer to that question thank you so much we also have another question for chris uh chris over here two people actually asking what is the seven step strategy could you elaborate on that a little bit more please yeah sure so um we we've uh we've defined the seven step uh strategy uh it's a big message to help uh customers align training goals with actual business objectives um so yeah well i won't go into too much detail um you know this um you know some of the main points here are you know defining what the what the future where you know where you want to go in the future and being very clear with that finding any gaps that you have uh between you know where you are now and the future setting strategic training and development objectives um and uh we have from you know various information that you know you'll find useful on that communicating uh the training purpose and objectives so it's um you know this is the most important part um overall and then you know delivering actually delivering uh the training the training process um and actually delivering the training and and uh you know into to complement these you you also need to try and support continuous uh learning within the workplace you know so you need to try and develop a culture within the organization that supports continuous learning and not just you know mandatory training or learning and you know what once uh you know you can do this by you know being in a position to offer you know some soft skills training or you know some training that um you know really uh the employees find interesting uh for their own and allow them to voluntarily self-enroll to those uh which can then um you know be part of a wider training program and not just the core um you know uh training that you want to deliver to your employees and then the final step is uh you know measuring all of this and you know seeing will work see what didn't work and repeat and try and iterate uh to to improve on it i will share more information on this with with both mike and paul to to share with everyone wonderful thank you chris thank you very much for answering that we have a couple more questions coming through in the q and a part and i do want to draw your attention most of you have already uh answered this you would have noticed when you came into the room that we have a poll uh this is a an e-learning endeavor july 22 poll asking which products or what products or services from new leaf interest you and i'm very happy to say that already 95 percent of you have answered that question so thank you very much uh paul i see that you've raised your hand did you want to add to what chris said over there at this stage no i did i did thank you very much i think it's quite important um really just to unpack a little bit about the sort of implementation process of an lms and it's wonderful to see um both from both presentations from stefan and from chris you know that process and in essence what we see in the market uh it's always quite interesting because learning and development departments have got their own opinions in the organization and those opinions usually focus around uh so much admin that they haven't got time to do anything else and also they they're a lot more focused on learning outcomes so what's good for the learner so there's a conversation that we have with learning and development and that they themselves have have that unique outlook then we have a different discussion with perhaps the head of finance you know the bean counters that they really look at the bottom line and how much is it going to cost and it's important that they see a return on investment that's what their lives are about then we have a completely separate discussion with the i.t department and that's obviously a very technical discussion and it's also a discussion around security so three different discussions happening um within the same organization so getting companies together getting them strategically aligned is a very important part of the whole process of deploying a learner management system so as a business we are not in the market to sell products that's not what we do so you know quite often somebody will pick up the phone and say send us a quote for that's not really something that we like to do so we would prefer to spend a bit of time and unpack those requirements a little bit more understand them a little bit more so that we can position the correct product for the the right client you know you'd make sure that the functional side of it's there make sure that there's a a plan a proper strategy and a process laid out and then we can start looking at the numbers the other thing that i think is quite important is certainly you know with with all of these sort of pop-up companies happening all over the place um both from a content perspective you know from a content perspective just about every ad agency as it went through covert suddenly become e-learning specialists and actually they're not specialists at all they're perhaps very good graphic designers but they don't have the underlying um experience around the didactics of learning and learning outcomes and those sorts of things so our business is really it's not about just sort of saying there you go it we really like to partner with clients and that partnership starts at when they start looking around for a learning management system we'd like to help them in that process let's find the right system and then let's find the right strategy and then let's find the right bits and pieces to make sure that we've got the correct outcome and that deals with change management it deals with internal communications it deals with the technology side of it it deals with all of the touch points it also extends beyond the date of launch so we have customer success managers allocated to each account and their role is specifically to make sure that the company is is using a product and services and they're getting the outcomes that they want and it's a matter of investigating where are we at what's happened on a particular learning journey what could be done better next time and that might be a communication thing it might be the fact that we sending emails up to 100 people but only 80 of them have got email addresses you know you're starting off with the wrong foot so really simple things like that and i just wanted to make that clear obviously the common theme from what we've heard this morning is that buy-in from stakeholders and it's a matter of planning and prioritizing functionality but making sure that it's it's about the learner at the end of the day making sure that we can get those outcomes i see mike's got some comments yes absolutely mike i wonder if i could just give a bit of a practical example so we've heard from stefan and from chris on an approach but there are some practical tools that we can avail to you so i'm just going to quickly share my screen if you don't mind um and i just want to show you from an end result sort of perspective you know let's let's take a look at this specific environment of vitality one of our customers so you can see that there's a pretty robust learning experience and learning journey in this where it's giving a lot of insight it's a personal learning journey it's not one size fits all and this is sort of the objective on where you get to when we put that into practicality we have to look at these sort of frameworks where we ascertain what that content is where it lives and we look at the informational architecture available and map it out into a pretty robust process where we are taking into account you know the allocation the user matrix how that is going to be mapped out what's core what's mandatory what's just awareness training we're looking at those con those didactic conditions and when we're actually designing the content we're putting that into a course design structure where you know we've got to think about what's going to inspire our students at the end of the day and if we look at something typical you know in the initially we've got a course overview maybe that's around an introduction navigating the course you know what's in it for the learner what are they going to achieve here maybe there's a bit of a pretest where we can ascertain what their knowledge base is when they start in order to kind of correlate what that return on investment on the training initiative is then when they go through the topics we're giving anticipatory sets we're giving explanations we're showcasing we use all of the mediums available to us from an e-learning perspective be it animation or something immersive any sort of types of contents to really portray the information effectively to get to an end result where there is tangible impact on performance on return on investment so i just wanted to share some practical insight into that and we do have tools available uh to assist on top of those seven steps um that both stefan and chris alluded to there's some practical assistance that we can help out with too wonderful thank you mike i think that's very helpful to visualize it and actually see what you've done for an existing uh real life client so thank you for that we do have just a couple minutes left and i want to see how many of these questions we can get through right now uh the first one is what sort of trends are you picking up on as far as hybrid learning is concerned paul would you answer that or mike sure i don't mind uh chiming in there so from a hybrid hybrid approach you know we're looking at a blended learning approach and i think there's a stigma around blended learni
g being you know synchronous and asynchronous being instructor-led and something online so the blend really is between classroom and e-learning but i disagree with that i think it's a blend of approach where i see a lot of trends i think it's a bad trend lengthy virtual instructor-led training and you know i've got a story a friend of mine stayed over at my house recently working for one of the a very large bank within south africa they had an all-day long virtual instructor training session taking place through microsoft teams i can tell you now that it was on an ipad on mute she went to the shops came back and the poor facilitator on the other end is you know looking at the the cold web camera without any engagement there's no conversation there's no knowledge retention or even knowledge transfer taking place and that's a trend that i see all too often and you know you've got to use the tools available to you at least maybe do a pre-quiz before a virtual instructor training session to identify those learners competencies and where those knowledge shortfalls come into play and then tailor that virtual session to focus on the the actual needs of the learner rather than just doing this one-size-fits-all approach so that is a trend that i'm seeing in a very negative sense that's a very good point mike you you're talking my language over there i think that that's something that a lot of people can relate to uh and certainly there there needs to be some creative solutions to to do that in a more creative way uh let me ask you another question over here what would you recommend is best practice to drive a self-service learning experience for all users in the business especially where the culture is not to attend training unless they are forced i think it's fair to say that uh you know there's two two real approaches and it's quite simple it's the carrot and stick approach so you know if we incentivize learners and and let's look at that it doesn't have to be monetary it can be something based upon recognition that is going to create a little bit of excitement around learning um gonna give people a little bit of kudos you know that's a good start but in reality i don't think people just learn because you know very few just learn because they want you it's got to be a driven need and that driven need is is through uh you know if it's compliance it's compulsory it has to happen or there's a reason for them learning in so much they're chasing a career so if we establish proper learning pause for them give them recognition along the way and there's an outcome for them and that carrot i talked about is perhaps the opportunity to get promoted that's a good way of doing it the other thing that i think is very important is that we don't just drop people out there in the digital ocean to paddle on their own i think it's very important that we have instructors in the online environment that sounds a little bit weird but in essence we're trying to replicate that sort of classroom type of situation where there's somebody that they can go to somebody that they can talk to and that's going to engage them those instructors should have analytics what's going on they should have the capacity to communicate directly with those learners um a new spring for example got a very good notification center built into the platform where immediate discussions can happen and then finally the other thing that i think is quite important is peer-to-peer collaboration so things like discussion groups the capacity to talk to each other and encourage each other as would happen in a normal classroom should also be part of that to drive learners to to complete courses wonderful thank you very much paul and uh it looks like we are unfortunately out of time for today uh still some other questions over here one question i think that did come through that was probably needs to be answered like you mentioned paul on more of a consultative basis the question was how do we apply these steps in a fast-moving consumer goods type of operation where the majority of the employees are semi-skilled and that's something that's very particular to a specific company or industry and i think that refers back to that that comment that you made paul where people you know you don't like to just send a one-size-fits-all kind of quote but this is where if you can sit down and understand what a company needs that's where you become their trusted advisor like you said rather than throwing people into the digital ocean and having them swim on their own so thank you very much and certainly we'll uh address that that answer that question uh in in more of a one-on-one basis over there yeah certainly quite happy to to spend some time discussing that one with whoever asked it excellent thank you very much paul we also have had some a couple of people ask if this presentation will be uh shared but there is a recording of course that we are currently recording right now we will make that available to you and i think michael uh correct me if i'm wrong but we usually put this into uh the learner management system for people to have a look at is that correct right right elaine yeah so we basically avail the recording as well as all of the presentations um some of the tools and things that i mentioned towards the end here are all available in a very nice learning experience um and we will follow up this session with access to that so yeah please keep an eye out for it there's lots of tools and resources available to you and of course pop us an email we're always happy to share it directly as well that's wonderful thank you very much well with that i'd like to just say thank you to all of you for joining us today we really appreciate you taking the time out of your schedules to be with us for this e-learning endeavor for july 2022 again my name is ilan it's been a pleasure to host this and thank you very much to our panelists to mike to poor to stefan and to chris uh hope that you enjoyed it and we look forward to seeing you for the next e-learning in dhaba have a lovely day everyone thank you bye bye
thank you Mr President ladies and gentlemen I'm here today to talk about what the Youth of Africa can do for the country everything I have to practice put into my phone my advantage of it is local individual education and how technology has actually been continent so the picture up there is my grandmother her name is she is the one who took care of me she brought me down because I don't know my parents we thank you for all the report before I became an album she played the band a very important abandoned education to the point where she actually went to school district but she made sure that I went to school all the way to University almost everything she has to pull into school so I kind of regulating and I had to move to Accra for secondary education which of the map control the distance from the map from Qatar I made that way all the way to Ukraine by making a transcript in Italy that was back in 2003 2003 an African young man who went into Europe Salt Lake so I have to know there was no way of communicating with my school in Ukraine and I just had to be there before another batch of students coming from Ghana arrived at the airport and realized what are the senior schools and they allowed me in the students headed to school in UK but I felt like by come together need a love for me and how to come back so coming back I got the opportunity to go to eventually to digital communication and after doing that in 2009 I moved back on the state completely this is something most Africans will not use the the fact that they got a chance to go to Americans understand it but I felt to gather at least back so this is myself and a couple of my friends but there's 45 degrees Celsius only God knows how we are able to to survive uh fast forward this this code is one important code for me um that I really love you a lot and it's by the president of the London coffee government who says I believe everybody can read money to say this the major problem I see is that stories African stories is reaching from house somewhere else and not by African themselves that is I want to Define us they want to see the possession of Africa write our own stories because it is something I believe in if I have stayed in Ukraine and probably just didn't come back to Ghana who's going to write the stories about parents who's going to be what you're going to be using the social media Platforms in Ghana to tell a story about Ghana I believe in the fact that I have the chance to have the ability to do that and that is why I moved back how can we change the negative position of our heart attack everything that we are hearing about journalists moving to Africa to write stories about farming corruption on age and all this stuff how can we as citizens of Africa change this particular perception I'm just here to talk on behalf of the African leaders they are countless evidence of progress growth as well as political and economic pregnancy on the African continent why can't we say why can't we write about these stories why can't we push this information out there we find it difficult to to tell the stories ourselves a friend of mine actually described his whole experience as bad VR from Africa yes the foreign these are stories we need to talk about why are we just eating a lot of these stories Nigeria the continent most populous country has been enjoying City economic work since 2005 which recently gets written to as high as 7.5 percent for the period of 2009 to 2011 Namibia had the highest number of computers at 239 meters per 100 a thousand people and initiate the lowest at 100 000 people which is categorized among the energy number eight all the staff around the worldwide website you can go check them out yourself moving back to Ghana I made a couple experiences writing up in new Africa sharing it sharing is going to the new African album now so we started like a blogging mobility of blogger we are using blocks in social media as a change too we want to change the whole conversation if you don't want General music to be paid reminded to come to people in a Transit hotel to buy the stories of what we can write we want to write those stories we want to actually engage the government and produce those stories about their internet in Africa is a good point for us we are we are very the right way to use here is via US peace because internet is bringing Innovations to Africa so this is a picture of myself and a couple of bloggers we meet once every Sunday of the month to discuss social issues on projects and Shane and other people who are interested in working this is my personal book this is where I run a lot maybe after here if you want to follow my relation then I share positive stories about Africa about Ghana about technology about innovation yes I forgot to mention how children were left alone with technology are able to develop new ideas and all I am a typical example growing up I never have access to a computer but moving to the big city I wanted to consider so many very interested in computer science I mean how to play computers and all that as created with a little bit of human needs and they are able to pick up so easily on the iPad is doing something in that particular space December 2012 Ghana went to the polls before that myself and the other activist and bloggers with social media business I decided to monitor Ghana's political conversation before the election so we started a campaign called Ghana distance Canada this time is basically a campaign monitoring political conversations and elections in general so we it was not particular um and we basically monitor all political parties and their campaigns online we documented everything on social media we had Facebook Twitter blogs YouTube videos about everything it went all over the country talking to the youth addressing them about the leader the fact that this is the future they have to vote because the whole conversation was more of why do I have to go if my vote it just made a politician Rich he and his family Vietnam Bridge and they don't care about us but moving around the country and speaking to them and inspiring them this is the future we have people to change the conversation came from I'm not going to vote to London register to vote so if you saw a lot of Youth actually turn up on Election Day last second to vote in Ghana all because of Ghana exercise thank you that I decided we have a yearly program called blockchain Ghana is a country in the middle of Three French speaking countries we have supportive work to the dentist to the West um we're holding a vlog on Friends where president where were invited was one explained I really enjoyed because I wanted to pick up on my friends anymore and it was a great time to meet people I mean who will be following you and you're following them on social media style for a long time so we had a Blog camera where we had block training where young women to know how to Vlog will help we sat in the blog and those who already have a lot and wanted to tune up the envelopes were also assisted with that and the most important aspect I enjoyed was girls in ICT we stopped a lot of ladies tell us about our particular session where they wanted to learn about ICT because most events most technology events are focused on men you go and it's all men in t-shirts with laptops and that's it but for once the history of organization all over the country to participate in the girls and ICT especially where their fellow um girl who has a daisy who was the Blogger and a technology from there so this is the point I'm arriving at I accidentally this is the fact the world's impression of Africa is hopelessly outdated that is what the words he needs to be the sea to developed disease full of Guidance full of poverty full of farming and all of this negative attributes but we the new generation of Africa see Africa to be full of creativity full of jobs full of innovation it's not technology full of ideas full of Investments believe it or not this is what we want to achieve 10 years from now all our leaders will probably be advisors to us until running a various energy if we find our future innovation technology has been in the new Africa that is the main topic in this possible session we have a lot of tasks bringing out across the continents from Accra to Nairobi from Cairo to Cape Town we have a lot of innovation house cleaned up on the continent and they are not just pregnant because they're springing up they are springing up your presence they are changing the conversation in Africa they are helping shape Innovation they are heading to create local content I want to be able to come to Namibia and use my phone to actually know where I can find the best restaurant without calling somebody on the phone I want to use an Uber app developed by namibian to do that I don't want to have an app in Europe that will tell you okay go to here before you find this restaurant but you know what is develop ment because we have half in Accra we have to Nairobi have to keep it up all of them there's a map to go to show so there we have it all the red dots actually much better all over the country in this life but helping young people like myself and others develop local content we are developing local apps saving local problems currently in Ghana we have entrepreneurship for technology where students and I mean who've been to president in a two-year program to become software developers we can study our own business the era where young people are applying for jobs we are starting our own businesses there's the partnership between most North African countries and East African countries foreign Africa so this idea of the house in Africa we have practice Pages all of these labs are helping the young African people develop local content investor he came to Ghana and liked the texting and decided to set up a school to train young people to when I go to your training to become a software entrepreneur I am very proud to say that the first African act developed from Ghana and the new sold worldwide in the iTunes Store is the Iowa developing guide and this is no joke it comes the same to like almost the time he was in the hospital for after a while and this is the cooperation between maintenance developer and a Kenyan development District online and they create their own thing and yeah boom it goes to become business people so that yeah the government from last year happy to go to the world and destruction coming through in Accra is another space called high space it's called Innovation space it's a space floor entrepreneurship needs so a lot it's not only there this happens bringing up in Africa as well we are like screaming and in town in villages because of connectivity and in this areas Broadband is helping this whole conversation just to check out powered by Vodafone and I'm private in one of the countries um which is being run by ladies they are actually pushing for the activities to join them in developing us any fashion and e-commerce and all that this is the time when African lady shouldn't be fed by and let me give you for the men to do let me let me join them and also get it forward so I I have a video to show and I think I need to skip to the videos because what time is up thank you so this is the conversation between a lady climate in Africa and a taxi driver on the world market during the follow region Al four please lovely we're off today Africa oh Africa nice here's one for you what continent has six of the fastest growing economies in the world Asia isn't it wrong what it's actually Africa always including the question women well it's not African is it it is you know that's what makes it a surprising fact you can have it if you want what you know in fact you're confusing conversation with your other actors like uh put another big kid why would I want to use an incorrect statistic in a conversation with Penny who's going quite busy see this out of 10 of the world's fastest growing economies are in Africa with Richard rice or rarely yeah not a private can no well given that I think we can accept that it's Asia who has six of the fastest growing economists and not Africa they're bloody dozen you wanna check thank you it's about it thank you let us keep this young man
arner okay now you are going to explain this teack to us yes teack okay I think for for for me what's important is that e-learning is about learning before we get into this what does TAC stand for and I know you've got a slide up here that okay says it all it's a it's a whole mouthful it's technological pedagogical and content knowledge okay but what it really is is quite a brilliant model put together by two professors in the United States who were concerned about exactly this how do you know when Good e-learning is taking place because it's all very well to have e but if there's no learning then basically you've just got a bit of exciting techn and this is always what I worry about if people are just throwing technology at things and not actually doing anything about it I mean so what if you've got a whiteboard in your class and you're just writing the homework on it it's might as well just have a normal chalkboard means your hands don't get dirty yeah yeah I used to have this big thing of moisturizer on my desk it's pump action write something pump action Y yeah okay what does pedagogical mean and I'm a little bit embarrassed to ask that because pedagogy is something as a teacher we should know but it it feels like such an Airy fairy Cloud that like all teachers practice pedagogically when they go into class I think just sometimes we don't think long and hard about what it is that we're doing and what the pedagogical stance that we're taking so let me start with this way pedagogy in its simplest terms is how you teach okay it's the strategies that you put in place that will enable you to take the information that the or the skills that the Learners need to know about or develop and have the outcome that they can do or know what you want them to know now what makes at pedagogy for me is that it's the thinking behind the strategy so if your philosophy is that you are the holder of all information and the Learners are nothing more than empty vessels which it is and I am okay well then you're a trans you're going to use a transmission pedagogy and you're going to transmit information like a radio okay or like a tap and you're going to hope that you you're going to use ways of teaching that are just going to expect the Learners to be filled up and if they don't get filled up you're going to be very disappointed at the end of it yes whereas a teacher who believes that learning is about constructing knowledge that Learners are able to work with her and with others to develop knowledge the way that she's going to work in her classroom the strategies that she's going to use are going to be very different what do you mean construct and develop okay so the idea is working on the that all knowledge gets put together made up not made up as in let's make up a fantasy story but put together in terms of constructed so it's about providing the learner with enough scaffolding or support that's you're able to take them from what they know to develop more in more knowledge to what they need to know and without getting too deep into the whole constructivist debate and voty we can talk about it another time if you like I haven't heard that since I was in college right you see now every all teachers have done pedagogy at at Varsity level and stuff and then we go into class and we forget because we caught up with the doing and we lose a bit of the thinking sometimes and don't you think it becomes something that just happens that you develop your personality as a teacher and that's it but but that personality is part of that personality is what you believe about education and I find it very hard to believe after our discussion so far that you're a transmission teacher I have to tell you no I'm just saying it because so but but the point is that's part of your personality in the part of the way you think now what Tac does is it says reflect on the way that you're teaching reflect on the strategies that you're using because if you do that you're able to take the three elements the technological knowledge the content knowledge and your pedagogical knowledge and create lessons that are absolutely perfect e-learning so you're not talking about changing the way I teach nor are you talking about changing the content I'm teaching you're talking about bringing them all together to create a better lesson I think I am in some ways talking about the way that you teach okay in so far as what you can do is I can add a bit of Technology here and there and nothing's changed or what we can do is we can transform exactly what you're doing and have a whole new world but what I would like to do is maybe show you the model and then it'll make a little more sense perhaps so there's more there's more okay okay so let me just draw it as soon as you're a maths teacher you'll enjoy enjoy you're going to do some Vin diagrams oh good so let's start off with content now you're a maths teacher you've got math content knowledge yes and that's the minimum that we'd expect of a teacher that she's going to go into the classroom she's going to have the knowledge and she'll be able to use it yes what's critical also is that she knows how to select sources of that knowledge so she knows that she's got to choose a textbook that matches the curriculum it's going to be a caps compliance textbook book she also knows already that she's got to choose content that is going to match her learner abilities and levels okay right so content is a given okay she also goes in I've noticed that all of your teachers are she's funny that I'll I'll use a few he's for the for the next five minutes I'll talk about he right so the next all teachers I believe do have a fun fundamental understanding of pedagogy whether it's an expressed one or not they know how to teach okay and because otherwise they wouldn't be teaching they'd just be standing in the corner yes okay so now we do get some people who are content experts and don't know how to teach and I'm sure we've all experienced them particularly at universities brilliant mathematician can't get the concept across yes okay so the pedagogy is what allows the content to come across to the Learners Okay Okay the third element and we're doing e-learning technology is technology okay now when we're talking about technology we're talking about all the levels we're talking about the devices we're talking about the software we're talking about the content that works on the technology would overhead projectors also fit in there you love these overhead projectors I think they are the most underrated tool in the classroom everyone thinks they're old school throw them out but there's so much you can still do with them they're limited but they do have a place okay for me the problem is here is that because they used as nothing more than an easy writing methodology they are not great they don't allow adequate interaction in terms of the learner's work it's just teacher prepares the transparency puts it up or worst of all writes on it in front of them as the MTH teachers love to do and show the solutions and then you've done it once you don't have to do it again it's it's a wonderful experience Michael I'm not so but there is a lot more than you that you can do with that just like there's a lot less you can do with an uh one of those video projectors you could do the same thing exactly that's so key about the technology is that you understand what it is that that the technology can do for you you understand how to use the technology and little less important because they all seem to know how to do it already is that the Learners know what to do with the technology there's no point in put having technology that you can't use yes or don't know how to use or don't know what it can do or know what it can do so yes how Tac works for me is it looks particularly at all these intersections so you'll remember from maths and I think it's all the way back to Primary School that when you have different sets you got intersections yes now in the standard traditional classroom there's this intersection that exists between pedagogy and content a good teacher has good subject knowledge good ways of conveying that knowledge and getting the Learners to develop the skills and knowledge okay okay so I'm going to make you excited now because I'm going to say this is good but it's dated are you calling me old fashioned yes okay so it's dated because the truth of the matter is that our Learners have moved on from there and as teachers we need to be responding to our learners but it's not only just sort of cow Towing to the Learners it's about acknowledging that our Learners are going to have to do things once they leave school that we never imagined possible that we would ever do in our lives when we were at school and if we're not using technology and e-learning it means that we are hold holding them back from the very key things and key uses of technology I mean think about of petrol pump attendant petral pump attendant use technology every day they are online because they processing your credit card payment now you'd never have thought of that in in terms of the need for that man to be able to work with it so for me it's about making sure sounds horrible to say that somebody's dated but you can be good but dated now I'm thinking of this in terms of teaching mathematics and you always get the classroom at least uh the question at least once a week in the classroom when am I ever going to use this and I used to have the standard joke that um when you become a maths teacher then you'll use it but maybe by doing just the pedagogy and content I was letting them down I could have used that as an opportunity to teach something else 21st century skill as you talk about now I know that you and I talk about 21st century skills but I've just just realized that we haven't actually spoken about them at all so what I'm going to do is try and find a list of 21st century skills and put them up on the blog later and okay that'll be brilliant yeah okay so carrying on with teac then be next look at this little intersection over here yes contents and Technology Now teacher gets a new device in her class she thinks of he he yes he thinks of some exciting bit of content and sends the kids off to play with it what we have here is we've got it's exciting because the technology is exciting yes okay but it's limited and it's limited because what is happening is that there's very little pedagogical interaction there's no sense of so what purpose so if I take for example the app I spoke about earlier test yourself if all the CH all the teacher did was say download that app and on to the quizzes it's exciting CU now the kids have being tested in a different way but the limitation is is they're not doing anything with it all they're doing is answering questions big deal okay for it to become meaningful she needs to have decided well this is going to be a formative assessment opportunity it's going to I'm going to do things with it and that's where the pedagogy comes in Okay Okay the third intersection that we need to talk about is when we have pedagogy and Technology okay now content is missing okay so it's interesting because what we're doing is that we're doing a very how can you teach without content can't I show you how to use a device look at this lovely new toy I have as a teacher let's all turn it on turn it off and play with it and if I leave all the kids to do with whatever they want to do with it or I say to them oh yes you must go and download all the maths apps because they're going to help you with your maths it's interesting but the content is missing because as the teacher I'm supposed to be developing caps content knowledge yes that's what we're played to and paid we paid to do but often what happens is the pedagogy and the technology come together for interesting but content is missing or it's disconnected is a nice way of thinking of it okay I don't know how that can happen well okay but there's one spot in the middle okay the spot in the middle is the exciting spot I Like To Call It The Sweet Spot and The Sweet Spot is where good e-learning takes place because what we have is the content is being facilitated both by the pedagogy that the teacher is employing and technology and they're all working together at the same time it's not just a Content lesson it's not just somebody teaching and showing off with fabulous teaching techniques or just the technology existing you like the school that put up we have an interactive whiteboard and did nothing with it that's it yeah a thought has occurred to me that this is almost like uh creating a cake and I don't want to say bakon cuz then it applies everything else the content would be the ingredients that's what we've got to teach the pedagogy would be the instructions on how to make the cake otherwise called The Recipe can tell I don't cook and the technology would be the the technology used to make it the oven the oven yes and without making them work together you're not going to get the perfect cake that's it yes Dylan right something just occurred to me um the model you've just presented and Helen your analogy now baking a cake necessarily suggests that you can't have good learning without technology good point this technology in my opinion can be a paper textbook or an overhead projector or an overhead projector okay okay but we talking here about e-learning and so therefore we're talking about that whole sort of e technology and I suppose there is a danger when you throw in that kind of technology to get distracted by the technology where whereas when you're working with a textbook it's it's not distracting for you but when you have a tablet in front of you you've got Facebook possibly there or something else so you need to be more focused in how you use it I think we get a little too scared of Facebook and other such things too quickly for me if your lesson's engaging enough it never or let me put it this way if your G lesson is not engaging enough paper textbooks never stop children opening comic books to read or sending notes so what's the difference between scribbling a note to somebody or sending them a Facebook message if your lesson isn't engaging yes what whatever the technology you're using it's still going to have the same issue you know the type of classroom that's using the technology or using using this teac model effectively how do you when you walk past it is it going to be noisy is it going to be silent what kind of feeling will it have it depends on what pedagogy the teacher taken if she's using a pedy where you've got group work happening then probably it's going to be noisy if if she's using a strategy where the Learners are going to be working by themselves to write a blog for example for their English writing lesson well then it's a whole different sound that's going to come out of that room it really depends exactly how the technolog is been used used yes to achieve the content there is always an assumption that if you use technology the discipline's going to go out the window and it won't just be talking in the class which I don't have a problem with but I know a lot of my friends do uh it's also being distracted and things like that and I agree with you if the lesson is engaging enough if you have planned for um at this point we're going to do that and that point this and this and you plan for everything they don't have have time to be distracted by other things that's it yes now we have a slide of this V diagram okay what I think is the question that pops into people's minds when they present it with teack is so how do I go about planning a lesson yes and I think that's quite a key issue and because it's three circles you can enter it in whichever Circle you want okay I'm going to start off with content because I believe content is quite key and makes quite a significant point about the content that has to be covered so if we go into the content Circle we say how can I make the content more accessible to Learners okay okay now automatically it means that I'm going to come up with some sort of teaching strategy so I'm move to the pedagogy what pedagogical strategies can I use now the transmission teacher is going to use just that same old teacher standing in front chalk and talk full stop okay but a more creative teacher is going to use a number of different pedagogical strategies if I have technology and we've already acknowledged that textbooks are a form of Technology can the technology help me achieve the objective that I want okay what technology do I have available and then importantly do I and my Learners know how to use that technology Because unless everybody in the room is comfortable with how to use the technology no matter what you do it's not going to work now if you choose any objective in terms of the teaching you can plot through that and find out whether or not it's going to work now for me what I find quite useful when we think about the technology is Professor Hughes has come up with what she calls rat and she says does the technology just replace so if we go to the textbook again is the children is the child going to be reading a textbook on paper or is the teacher going to send the child to a website with the static page and tell them to read it there all that's happening is that the technology is replaced secondly she says the technology can augment what does augment mean add to enrich okay so we're not talking about augmented reality it can include augmented reality I think it's quite important because augmented reality does provide the opportunity for simulations to take place for example so it's adding to the teaching so in many ways I sort of think about it is that if if you put the textbook at the very base of it augmented would be all of the things that pre the exciting technologies that we have now that we used as teachers 20 years ago the listening to reading from Shakespeare for example Remember When hakes was augmenting the playing a mats game playing a mats game it's augmenting the learning and then the final thing and this is the big question is it transformational does the technology allow you the opportunity to do or achieve your objective in a way that changes everything that you've ever done before and quick easy example cuz I'm aware that time is running out is if you go back to the formative assessment example I gave you yes a teacher could do formative assessment by walking around the class observing making notes talking to the Learners taking in work over a period of time that's very effective methodology she can give them the app and then use the information that you can gain from the app to do it now what the app has done for her there is it's transformed the whole experience it's not just assessment it's assessment in a completely new way it's not I'd like to add to that because um there is a tendency to think well I'm testing anyway why must I do it on a device the ad advantage of that kind of model is that we are able to immediately get feedback and as a result immediately remedy so you're not having a week's waiting period where you are marking oh I hate marking and then you come back and by then you've already moved two topics down the line and it's too difficult to remedy the situation that's it and the child gets left behind yes or all 30 of them get left behind that's it yes so yeah so for me Teek and R are really exciting things and what we're going to do in the fourth webinar is show you some lessons some little mini lessons where teachers have or haven't applied this very successfully and we'll be able to talk about them and see how well this lovely Sweet Spot has being reached that's very exciting yes Dylan just a quick comment um in that fourth webinar maybe one of the questions that came up now um was uh does does the technology available now make the flipped classroom possible okay is that something that's coming up in the fourth webinar we will touch on it definitely yeah but we also talk about it next time when we talking about technology well now that you brought brought up next time let's look at what's up next and on the slide we have the first point how do technology and e-learning work together okay well we're going to be very briefly what we're going to be looking there at the Technologies available and what you can do with them in terms of learning okay okay okay uh number two what do we mean by technology I think going back to the early the first question I think we had today was about this m learning we sort of think about technology as only been certain things you know computer and computer lab and I believe that it expands far wider than that so I want to look at what technologies there are to use in the classroom and the last Point what technology is available for e-learn I think that's self-explanatory now are there any parting remarks you would like to make because there is one I'd like to make but I'd like to hear from well thank you for your interaction I've really enjoyed being challenged on it I hope I've managed to convince you a little more that you can become a little less skeptic I think I'll always be naturally skeptical that's a good thing but it's good to test things out and good to not just accept everything yeah yes good um Dylan any parting remarks I'll save it for next time okay the thing I would like to say is that this kind of change from replace to augment transformation is not something that happens overnight yeah and it's something that happens week by week slowly doing one small thing at a time and yes you start with just good but dated and then move on to exciting but limited and maybe do a couple of interesting but disconnected from the content but you slowly get there and it's a learning process and a reflected process and everyone's going to fail at this at first I would say everyone's going to have a different experience of at first I don't anybody going to fail because I think often what happens is you will move through The Sweet Spot in a lesson you will there will be a time during any lesson where it will all have come together and a good teacher is somebody who can look back at the end of the lesson and say well gee I managed that amount of time in The Sweet Spot how did I get there yes and what made me leave it so that next time around I can in increase that and enhance that time yes so it's really a message of encouragement carry on reflecting carry on growing yourself developing yourself because you are responsible for your own professional professional development and acknowledging that content teachers are content experts they are pedagogical experts the technology is just adding a new twist into it that's going to be able to transform their teaching and transform the learning for the Learners yes okay we have run out of time it's been wonderful having you I look forward to having you again next week see you next week yes thank you for joining us goodbye [Music] cheer"
my favorite part was the hackathon it was just unbelievable to see the talent of these young people that came together in new teams that were created during this this event and in three and a half days built incredible technology I think you know one of the one of the themes of my own talk was about the fact that it's not just about tomorrow it's about today and I I noticed that there are so many tools that we learned about during this event about how we can use technology today to improve today not just tomorrow you
all right uh very good a very good morning to all members who have been in position to join at this session uh we want to thank god for yet another opportunity that you have granted us to have a session like this one just a reminder this uh training is organized by md5 actually organized and fully funded by a default uganda and it is also coordinated by the christian schools owners association meanwhile the training partner the training is being implemented by itau which is the ict teachers association of uganda the main reason behind the organization of this training is to equip teachers with e-learning with a learning skills to make sure to do to train teachers such that they can be able to start their own e-classes during school lockdowns so today we are blessed again we are going to have an another session where one of the our facilitators by the names of mr godfrey is going to lead us he's going to guide us how best we can utilize a google classroom in conjunction with whatsapp for learning most of the time during school lockdown schools have jumped into the pool of utilizing whatsapp as a platform for carrying out a learning but we are going to understand the the challenges that come along with using whatsapp and we shall also look at what benefits are there when we use google classroom as our lesson management uh platform so during the session mr gottfried is going to guide us very well and he will practically guide us how to utilize the two platforms in conjunction uh in order to see that you as a teacher or a school can run a successful a learning program so as usual i would want to welcome a participant to lead us with an opening prayer and then after we shall invite our lady facilitator today to take it on so in a participant yes mr chris go ahead and unmute and then you read as we run opening fire thank you very much all right all right uh as we sit here we believe that all good things come from god and from the lord and yes as we sit i will we all believe that all good things come from god and we would like to thank god for the beautiful night that we had we thank god for the life that he has given to us an opportunity to have another day and experience all the good things ahead of us we want to thank god for the opportunity to be in this training we thank god for our facilitators we thank god for it hello am i the only one who is not hearing mr chris okay i i believe mr chris has ended the prayer though i went here at the ending part of his career i want to take this opportunity to welcome our lead facilitator to take it on since we do not have much time during this session so mister yes please i just take it on because of time all right thank you so much george um we'll go right away to the presentation uh these are this is uh uh i want to say good morning everyone before i continue uh today we are looking at what how to use whatsapp and a google classroom it is it is fully funded and supported by edify uganda under the the e-learning project so we have we have ed fires our founder and we have csoa christian schools owners association those are the people that are coordinating the schools where you teach and we have ict teachers association of uganda italy where i come from and we are going to look at how we can use uh whatsapp and google classroom while we are teaching um let us look at the inventor facilitator i am god from kissa i'm a victory trust specialist take the newer i don't know i spelled it but i'm gonna take i'm an evangelist i come from those people who who who pray to god while shouting i'm the founder and ceo feel that these are my projects fill that you'll find out from that website and there's also another i also just at the finance foundation we are undertaking a project a few night open education resources projects at www.edutech.club and when you go there you even find the live stream on youtube those for not being able to join the zoom when you go to edutech that undertake that www edutech.com for the slash webinar you'll find the morning session and be able to see this event live on youtube um these are my contacts i i request that members everyone who is on call to save my number because we are going to to try out today broadcast how it works i will share with you this this presentation in your whatsapp using the broadcast that we are going to look at under whatsapp this is my email address this is my website and what we should be able to do under whatsapp we should be able to create whatsapp group edit the info add the contacts invite contacts via via the links and they know how to use the broadcast lists under a google classroom you should be able to join to join i believe everyone know how to join because you're already in the google classroom we should be able to create a class edit info more settings add teachers students and they know how to navigate and use the glassware tab uh whatsapp is a cross a cross platform messaging app for smartphones that allows you to send text messages and make voice calls using your phone's internet connection in addition to sending text you can send pictures videos judgments and voice messages you can create a whatsapp group with up to 256 participants how to create a good sub group simply you have to go to the chat tab and in what in whatsapp those notes in the app that right hand corner and then you create a new group if you have an exiting an existing chart on the chat style the new group there is another option if you have not you you are new you have just gotten the phone and you have just done the whatsapp it will just come uh here and away at the chats where you chat with people where you can create the new group you can search the contacts to add in the group then tap next you enter group subject this will be the name of the group that all participants will see the subject limit is 25 characters you can add a group icon by tapping the camera icon you can choose to take a photo choose choose a photo or search the web to add an image once set the icon will appear next to the group in the chat tab tap create when you are finished then let's look at how to invite the wire group um to invite groups via rings here i think you you have seen this we have shared even in the what's up group for those who wanted to join and have not joined if you if your group admin you can invite people to join the group um sharing a link with them the admin can reset that link assuming you have set the you have send sent to the link and you have all the people you needed you can reset the link at that time at any time to make the previous invite link invalid and create a new link so open whatsapp group chat then tap the group subject that's how you do it alternatively swipe the group to the left the chat we are going to see more as practically but um i've created i've made the serif study step by step when you read this you'll be able to to understand let's jump to how to use the broadcast with the broadcast lists feature you can send a message to several of your contacts at once broadcast list has saved lists of message of message recipient that you can repeatedly send broadcast messages to without having to select them each time just like you send a message to one particular person you can send it to all those 256 at once that's what you are going to look at this is how the it is done we are going to do it practically but if you don't do it you come back and read this because i'm going to share it um you can edit the broadcast list this is how you can do this is a step by step and let's jump to google classroom google classroom is a free online service that lets teachers and students easily share files with each other teachers can post assignments for students complete and then grade them all without without having to print anything so the cost of printing is solved when you're using google classroom all you need is a device and internet connection it also serves as a way of communicating teachers can post announcements and upcoming assignments as well as email both students and their parents however the the google classroom you get on a personal account you may not be able to send it to parents but for us we joined it the other area before they restricted it it was possible but now they put it on a paid version and the other is that version which is a free but for codifying institutions which is formerly known as this suite for education but now it's called google workspace for education it relies heavily on the use of google drive a free cloud-based file sharing program it allows teachers to use google docs google forms and many other google services to create and store assignments so when we are looking at google drive where that one is a we knew that we need it when we are learning to use google classroom that's why we learned it first with google docs you will have to find out there are some notes in the in the internet you you you go and search for that uh actually when you get this presentation you'll be able to click just click on this link it will take you to the to the tutorial for google docs and google forms we created we used we learned about that with the mr m road and you realize that this this knowledge was preparing us for this lesson how to access google classroom all you need is is a google account i believe everyone has a google account we're going to see how you can access it from just through the email address but you can also type this as long as we have logged in or you you as long as you have a google account your gmail there's also mobile app that can be downloaded on both iphone and android devices the mobile app is a great is a great for accessing your classroom on the go but you probably have an easier time of time performing tactics like grading and creating assignment on a computer so as a teacher while you are using a phone iphone or android device you should make plans to get one in up to save some money and get a laptop now when you are creating a class you remember where you clicked when you are you are joining that's the this time you have to create a class there is a notification that will come just accept and continue for example then you need you don't need to enter the name of your class this is the example of the class there are there is also the option to enter a section subject and the room if you are using google classroom in a school and want to include this information when you are done sorry you want to include this in information and when you are done you just click create so for me i advise you first first click type the name of the class when you type the name of class just click create then you you will edit that you are going to see it in the next slide navigating google classroom once you have created a class you'll be taken to the class page click the buttons in the interactive sorry this is this was this content was good from the internet the interactive uh the interactive is not here um just you get a page like this um adding students your class via email once you have created your class you need to add your students to it one method you can use is to invite students via email you must have a list of them um assuming they could they filled in a form those images are saved in one column you can just copy them and paste so you see how important the google forms are you don't have to type the image they have to fill the form and just copy them and invite them to do this you first need to navigate to the people tab here at the people tab when you click the people tab this is what happens it's what you see teachers students you you just have to this will bring up a menu where you can type your students uh students various email address once you've added this you click invite this will send an image to your students with a link inviting them to join your online classroom adding students with a class code the second option for adding students to the your class is using a class code this is a shortcode that anyone can use to join your trust if you provide them with it there are a couple of places to access the class code first click the stream this stream tab when you click the swim tab then you'll find a class called within the class information section if you want to enrich the code to show the class you can click the four corners icon here another way to access the class code is to first click the class settings icon in the top right corner um these

for this example select only teachers can post or comment by selecting this option teachers will have control over the information posted in the stream adjusting yeah just yeah and just want to chip in there because i i may not get time again on that first go to the previous slide all right okay so members if you look at our government classroom which we are using we use the actual students can only comment when mr mukissa [Music] an announcement or an assignment you can go in the then you can comment but you you cannot post in the stream directly we saw it it is better that way because if you leave it the first option after their students can post and comment their sub stream will be the google classroom stream will become like what's up because there will be a lot of teachers the important messages are there then learners post other things others post assignments in the wrong place so it's better to use the second option of students can only comment yeah that is what i wanted to check in at that point you can proceed all right now adjusting email notification settings just as you saw when i i will see here when i open my email i some i didn't put the settings so i have a

workspace for education yes please i'm afraid our time is far much moving and we are left with the team yes yes [Music] yes it's fine what what we do i've already set myself here to do a quick demo here on phone i'm going to call you to wrap up with a few things let me first share because i see you had gone to the last screen um you are going up to the last page of the assignment we have finished the presentation so yeah members i'm actually here in the google classroom [Music] are you able to see my screen okay so i'm here in the google classroom of our training and um i'm trying to post an assignment the assignment for today because the wisdom case has taken us you see we are different facilitators and we teach in different ways so mr mckees has decided to create a detailed presentation that we are going to share with you i was seeing some members in the chat saying they are not able to read the words you are going to get to the powerpoint and you are going to have a step-by-step guide on that but this is the an assignment that we are trying to post uh one we want you to create a google classroom for your class so i'm going to create a go classroom like for example for p4 or 4p5 google classroom and so maybe part of this program you see here i'm having google classrooms we are training we are training learners over seven thousand learners in edifying a learning project and all those learners they are in these google classrooms we create so we have a go classroom for p6 for p2 for p1 for p4 the google classrooms are the ones which the learners use to access the notes to do the work all the work is submitted there so we want you to in the assignment you are going to create a google classroom similar to this in the learners click on classwork they see subjects the topics the topics are the subjects mr presentation has talked about using topics so if you are creating a class for p4 we want to see religious education as a topic mathematics as a topic uh english as a topic and then we associate to studies as a topic science and then under those topics we shall you'll be submitting the work these things which have created bodies are they are the assignments whereas these ones which have this symbol are the notes so the learners will be finding the notes and everything inside the google classroom so yeah so if the assignment wants you to create a google classroom for your class then you are going to add a co-teacher so you add another colleague some of you are saying you don't have friends whom you can use to test you can use another email to be the teacher now you can invite your second email as a teacher but because you can't be there when you don't have a friend you don't have the teacher so in this classroom the verified we have teachers so they're created by edify and in these teachers we are added as co-teachers into the classroom so you will have to add your multimedia co-teachers with mr mikisel presentation as demonstrated and uh you can invite learners to your class either using the class call or using the link so when your learners come they will be able to join your google classroom using the class code as you have been doing with this one already you know because you have been using it to join the classroom now we want you to upload as material you're going to upload a youtube video and the presentation you created already remember we created so for example uh in this assignment which i'm creating here you can create uh you can create a youtube video if you have to add it like this assignment i'm posting it i'm i've added here uh using uh add youtube video and it's add youtube video then it will ask you to put in a url so you go to your youtube channel and you get a youtube video that you uploaded remember we already created the youtube channel so you create you copy the link of that youtube channel and then you come here and then you put it as a material here as material and then you will be able to insert it into your work they will added this one is here so that is one thing that you have to do then you are also going to create a quiz a quiz um when you are creating a quiz already we talked about creating quizzes let me just show you something small here we we talked about creating quizzes mr mr emory showed us how to create quizzes so um let me just do some small demo here let me go to let me switch to this account so so you should be able to create a quiz assignment because assignment will be created by let me just go in here so you will come here and you say classwork and then you click on create and then you say with assignment so when you say quiz assignment here you come here and put quiz uh on quiz on uh on which topic is there in science choose a topic that you you want or you can say maybe on e-learning let me put the keys on e-learning so you can choose a topic and then here you can put the instructions and tell the learner that please open the quiz um please open the quiz and attempt so you will choose you will put the instruction and attempt now there is something known as black ops which is going to be created here automatically for you this side where there is the topic you choose the topic the subject if it is e-learning if my for example i'm creating a quiz on google collaboration tools i'll choose that as my topic but when i say the topics are the subjects science english math those will be the topics so you can say create topic and you put in that okay then you from there you open the form so it is going to open the form using google forms which we looked at already so you come here to become already set as a quiz so uh you come and then you start putting your keys here e-learning quiz uh so we taught you this and we are not money to get assessing it so this is the chance for us to assess this so e-learning quiz and then you start putting in your what you are topic which of the following tools are google tools whichever you so you put those the way we demonstrated it the other day so you should be able to do that and i used to give it a title yeah learning learning quiz okay so that is that after doing that you just click on assign assign here and then it will be assigned to all the learners now for me here this is a test that he has actually been assigned uh if i go under google tools it is here with elani yeah i can delete it because
i don't want it yeah so that is what you are expected to do and uh this uh module create a piece or at least five questions uh on uh okay let me just specify create a much quiz about or about e-learning uh so use the use the knowledge you have got from this particular training and the set and exam if you were the teacher set about any of the things we have learned zoom and all those things then create a sample whatsapp group and invite and include the link to whatsapp uh in the google classroom so we want you to go to your class in the stream and you post announce here post and post the other hello members this is our sub group and post the link there in the in the in the in the google classroom post the whatsapp group link inside the google classroom so that is the what we want you to do there post the include the link and also you'll go to the whatsapp group and take a screenshot of yourself group that you have created now you are going to submit the three items via google classroom you submit a link to your google classroom the link to your whatsapp group and also the screenshot so this assignment is right now live i'm assigning it right now uh and it is now they are ready for you to start working uh you are 100 134 of you have already received the assignment so you should be able to do this assignment we are around the whole day we don't want this business again hopefully i'm not understood in this assignment we have also included reference material the video they did a complete tutorial there are three things that the number of videos here that we have added uh on this you'll see there is this particular station which is streaming it is already here attached for your reference uh there is a video that we created earlier on using whatsapp detailed detailed video on using and creating whatsapp group it is already here it is on on youtube so you can be able to you are going to be able to watch this video okay so when you open whatsapp sometimes it brings these adverts first yeah but uh the video is there already we we handled this in the in the previous e-learning uh in a previous e-learning cupboard so there's a detailed video there showing how to create a whatsapp group and how to do everything that you needed to do yeah so you try to do that then there is another one here on how to attain and it is a complete google classroom trailer by kevin uh stratvat so basically that should be able to guide you in addition to this one hour that we have for the training i should be able to watch some of those videos to supplement on what you have to do uh so maybe uh as i also uh finalized and i hand over to mr to wrap up uh i'm also sharing my phone yeah so for those of you because most of you are using phones uh so when you are seeing the computer screen there you are seeing stars because you you don't have a laptop yeah but if you're using a phone it is going to be easy for you you just go to play store play store is this one a play store is that one you search for classrooms you search for classrooms so when you click search for classroom if you have installed it to be there it is not there you click on open so when you create your classroom you realize that there is nothing you don't have any class if it's the first time but but for you before you already have in the cohort class there so you can either join a class or create it this time we want you to create you have always been the only joining now it is your time to create it so you come here and say p ah for class so you come there and you put there your maybe before

phone screen is off eeee hello radius is experiencing network challenges someone tried to call on it click on the create button rajas hello okay someone calls my phone those are some of the things actually if you are going to be teaching learners you may have to get a wireless router and then you don't put a sim card in the gadget you're going to use for classes like that you don't receive because oh you put in some line which people don't you know you should have a special gadget for e-learning and if you are going to teach you have another data lines then you put in the phone so that people don't disrupt you so please you try to create a class under class work here you can still create the assignment here you cannot create a quiz easily on phone the quiz works well on what on the compute on the browser if you have to create a quiz with a phone you will have to open chrome you'll have to open chrome and then you you open classroom google classroom hey so i know some of you are using phones that's why we have that so you search for google classroom if you have to create the the quiz it will be difficult for you in the app so you open google classroom and then you open you you turn your phone into what you call desktop mode so after creating your class the other side it you you'll still be able to access after creating your class you should be able to access so for example i used this account uh to create the class so after if i open my my google classroom the class i created it using the app but when i come here into the browser i'll still be able to to see the

wanted to wrap up but uh what we have to tell you just give you an overview what you are supposed to do as you are attempting the assignment but this is not all like i said we have uh tutorials to guide you and also we are around to help you so if you have to do the assigned to the quiz bit you can also log into the the phone and you use the browser and you go to desktop site mode and there you'll be able to get access all the options that are there on the phone as well yeah so that is what i was trying to share with you uh and it is at this point maybe because of time let me end here we shall add on we shall add on from there so you'll be able to open the class go to classwork tab and uh create a new a create a new a new quiz or create a new assignment everything you'll be able to see the options there in your phone in your phone browser you should be able to find all the options there in the controls okay so that is all uh which i wanted to add on that you can be in time and and get an overview so please do submit the link to the what the google classroom the link to the whatsapp group and the screenshot of your whatsapp group [Applause] that has been good um i want to challenge you members when the government when the schools across government did self-study materials i've made sure that i take time and prepare that content as a self-study guide you can use it uh step by step and do it please try to use it and to help you to assess is the self-study material possible can i create content and someone at home use it without watching the video and just step by step and they do i trust me you will like it because it is going to be able to show you when you have your phone just open the presentation on your phone and also opening maybe the google classroom there's a way you click on the left hand bottom corner of your phone and it opens just two tabs then you just click on one of them uh and then you look at what the the assignment is doing you look at i will create like a simple video and show you how i do it on the phone that you read from the the presentation what you are doing whether you are using the same phone so members i wish you well but in the evening you shall be able to do it practically today i wanted to share with you this in the presentation so that you can be able to follow step by step thank you so much that's all let's link up in the evening okay thank you so much uh mr makissa and mr rajas for taking us through maybe just a second um so that is what don't feel that they are they are lost out so my phone earlier i was refusing to load because i was yeah but you see here right now i'm using a browser actually i'm not even using the app so the this class i created it using the app but right now when i went into the browser chrome i can still open the class and i can go to classwork tab and i can click on create and there's quiz assignments i'm using a phone and i'm using i can come here and i have my blanket

everything the way it is on the computer yeah so i can zoom in and i can do whatever i want so members those of you without computers you don't have an excuse you should be able to do all the assignments in this training mr mode over to you okay thank you so much rogers for that insight i do really want to appreciate all the members who are positioned to join the facilitators for their input to sit with that they really guide you and they enlighten you on how to utilize this uh technology of uh google classroom so i will simply make i'll request all the participants here to embrace uh uh and they take time to study the self uh study guide that mr mukesh has created and also watch the videos that are going to be that have already been attached to the assignment and trust me you are going to learn something and you are going to enjoy utilizing google classroom as your lesson management a platform rather than making your phone to be cluttered with a lot of material because once you once you keep on using whatsapp as you are i mean as your platform for delivering lessons trust me your phone is going to be full that will reach a time that you lack against space your phone starts freezing and the reality you'll get challenges with your device and yet with google classroom because you already have a google drive you have a space you storage a space where all that material can be kept and you can have it for centuries and centuries meanwhile with whatsapp someone can steal your phone and then you end up losing all the content which was already uploaded on the whatsapp phone that is that you are using for carrying out the learning so as usual we cannot elaborate we cannot finish up everything within the one hour session during the course of the day we are available on whatsapp you can in a box any admin you can post a question and we are really ready and we are available to guide you in case of any challenge that you need and then we shall also have more demonstrations like what's up we have not done much on what's up mr mukissa talked about broadcast list so hopefully in the evening session we are going to have a demo on that i want to thank you all for being patient up to this time and uh since it is already time i would want to call a participant to lead us with a closing prayer then a volunteer to lead us with a closing prayer i can see madame harriet madame [Music] i can see your picture leaders is a closing prayer can you hear me yes we can hear you okay thank you so much the name is the name of the father and of the son and of the holy spirit heavenly father would like to thank you for this technology for all the people who came out with all this that we can be able to share with everyone and be able to learn a lot of things further we ask you to continue guiding us and giving us the capability to be able to continue learning to be able to transfer the knowledge to other people and our students further we ask you to give us health peace freedom and as we prosper thank you father for we have been able to attend this class and when you continue to guide us and we can be as able to be able to attain we've been able to bring this through our lord jesus christ the name of the father and of the son amen amen thank you so much guys see you in the evening at eighth shop we shall be beginning with our wrap-up session okay have a good day thank you next time officer you can end the meeting you're the host mr motif
the final stage um the final section of this course is um on how we can get especially all the information that has been entered into the system and be able to develop or do analysis on them so in this section um or in this video I'm going to do a demo on how we can retrive all the information that we've collected especially at registration the participants engagements you remember when we're looking at the critical information one of the key information was course information what course are they enrolled in what are their completion rates when did they start when do they when did they end all this information is now in the system and we are going to be able to see how to retrive this um in the manual I indicate that this functionality is only available to people who are who are a manager or an administrator on the platform so if we go back to the platform now so if I come back to the dashboard so typically when you log into the platform it will bring you to this dashboard and um so if I click on reports and analytics um it will load the advisor reports which is a fancy dashboard that has been developed for the system now this dashport has some information that's available to you at a glance uh but the information is from the 16th of August to the 22nd of August so the last 7 days if you see here now the information generally in the overview when we scroll down the report the dashboard also has different tabs so the first tab gives you an overview and there are specific indicators that we've been we've included here so basically the site overview how many active users and course enrollments and all of that and then number of visits uh how many people are visiting um and what's the average number of visits on the site um and you can view this by user who is registered on the platform and then if if you scroll down you should be able to also see time spent you can view this by user as well um you can also see um time spent on course on a specific course um course activity status uh time spent on the site course progress um and this this is dependent on the cost for example I think if I did the capacity building which is the active course right now second cohort you will see um 23 students at 20% um eight students at uh 61 to 80% so you should be able to see how students are progressing and here you will see how many students on the course enrollment block how many students are enrolled in each of the courses now of course all these figures are still um dummy figures we'll be able to clean up the database before launching the platform and then uh popular courses depending on enrollment um what's the most popular course and then certificate starts when we end up issuing certificates you'll be able to see who has been issued a certificate um and then users you can view users who is active who is currently active who is not active and then of course uh the this is a heat map that shows you activity uh within the different hours of the day we see that most people are active during the day and then in the nights they just a couple of them who active so it's most busy maybe at 2:00 p.m. to 300 p.m. currently that's when most people get onto the platform and then we see Learners so daily activities how many Learners have logged in how many teachers have logged in and how many hours are they spending on the site and then of course also inactive users are highlighted um and then grids um how how people grading what's the average grade on the platform overall you can also view this by course and um by user and then of course um course progress how people are progressing and then this is a custom report we are going to see how to develop custom reports this is a custom report that sort of picks all the user data so you can see the username user email first name last name time spent on site uh Skill Center they attached to their unique identif fire course they enrolling um whether they their status um course name they enrolled in so you'll see the courses they enrolled in when did they enroll in that course and what is the progress and of course there are many more fields that are depending on the interest and this is um this can run up to um so it's list up to 46 so all the users the information is here and the other benefit is that if you're interested in this data you can click on these four arrows and download it so you could download it in PDF you could download all the data in a CSV file you could download it as an Excel or you can actually even send it to um over to someone's email um directly um such that they can access it and see you can actually also shed you a frequency at which uh people um asent um this this data so that that's all add added functionality and then this is also another custom report that I developed that shows user completion status and like I mentioned we are going to develop one together and this report is also available for download so you can download um the course the information directly so um so that's the overview um and you can keep adding reports down there to the overview then when we come to the courses so there's a courses tab you can view a summary of all courses you can view course activities summary you can view activity completion summary and also cost completion so if we for example come to course um summary you will see that um it's really a rundown on all the courses how many I enrolled how many have completed how many have not started so really a big big overview of the courses and um again this can be downloaded if you're interested in just this report can be downloaded can be sent over email um if you need that and um when we come back here sorry I need to go back I should have I think I clicked somewhere I'm not supposed to click um so if we come to course activities now you you want to view the activities and see what's going on in the different activities so you can specify the activity here uh you can exclude inactive users um just to be sure that you're getting accurate information and again you can also download this report um in Excel in CSV in PDF and be able to send it over um as well to someone else um when we come to course completion again you they it will show you how many courses uh people have enrolled in how many have completed and what's the average grade again this is criteria that's preset within the platform so it will show you the different uh participants and um what courses they enrolled in and um once again if you need to download the courses are available then the Learners tab has learner summary so you this will show you details of the all the Learners and what you can learn about them so give it a minute to Lord so I forgot to mention that this is actually based on um you can you need to specify the course up here so when we come to Learners um you can specify again the course or you can do all courses then be able to view um the different larner details who's active who's inactive and what are they doing um so again I I think you need to explore that and you can again like we saw in the overview you can specify the time frame that you want could be a custom date could be um another area so again you can download you can you also have an option of telling it to display everyone um you can say you can choose to what to deactivate there and um learner course activities again there are various options for you there to explore I think as you dig into the course I want you to use the opportunity to explore those further and then the custom reports which is the functionality that I want to show us so we know that we can't customize for every everything so this is an opportunity for you to be able to create all sorts of reports that you're interested in creating that you will find valuable so this could be so this has four filters so the cohort filter the course filter the user Fields filter and the coures course field filter so let's say I want to generate a report on how people perform in in um the way is the second cohort so let scoll through I could actually type here capacity building know so this is second cohort so I want to know how many users what users are participating in this course so will organize them how much time time have they spent on their course um and what are the so how much time okay let's do gender as well and then let's do the course name we've already specified that so want enrollment date course progress and um activities completed and um okay let's just do those fields so you will see that generates for me the data of all the users who are currently enrolled in that course and um tells me what progress these people have made Alan is at 15% 40% so it's keeping track of everything that they're doing then how many activities have been completed as well so it keeps track of that then I can simply say create report once I've specified the fields and I can say capacity building um cost second cohort completion report and so I can say second so it asks a short name as well and that's required report and so I say enable download and add to the reports dashboard if you want to see it you'd have to add it to the reports dashboard and then click on Save changes so automatically it's added to the uh uh reports available now the custom reports and you can remove it from the dashboard if you don't want people to see it you can leave it there you can edit the report um you can delete it or you can change the settings so if you want to see it so of course you can see it here but um if I want to download it I will go to the overview tab and then scroll down so it's at the bottom so it's here so when I click on this uh three dots I should be able to download that report in Excel let's download it and um let's see how it looks like in Excel clicked somewhere so so if I come to my downloads and uh open the folder okay here it has here it is it has opened up so you can see the first name last name time spent agenda course enrollment and uh progress so then I can use this data whichever way I can so I could um run a pivot table whatever analysis I need to do with it I'm now I can now comfortably do that and um achieve whatever results I need to achieve thank you very much I hope you've enjoyed this course and this session um we eagerly looking forward um please provide any feedback on how you felt the course was and how we can improve it thank you so much

knows what your password is and then enter the email address now the platform will ask for your email address twice so please be sure you enter the right email address I have a dum email address that I'm using for this demonstration so y a ELP register gmail.com and then uh the first name I'll call myself y a l p and last name register uh city or town I'll say laka let assume I'm from Zim from Zambia then select the country from this drop- down list so you should be able to select the country and then the guardian's name I'll say my guardian is called Alan then date of birth let say 13th

young Africa student who is already attached to a Skills Center you will choose the very first option um but you could also be a non young Africa student but attached to a skill center um or an organization that young Africa is Affiliated to so for that option you choose the second uh response and then if you're not in any way connected to Young Africa you will choose non ya student not linked to any ya Center um or if you're teacher or trainer you choose that that option so we'll choose that we'll choose um NY a student linked to a young Africa Center so if you're linked to an organization you would choose that organization from this drop down list otherwise do not choose anything and it will be left blank if you link to a center so let's say I'm linked to um the young

assuming I'm from laka and then um disability uh no disability so I'll I'll choose no um under that drop down and then um highest level of education completed let say secondary school but there are various options here that you can choose from uh please choose the option that is closest to um what represents your current status so maybe I dropped out of secondary school current employment status

economic activity so at the time of enrolling at Young Africa were you involved in any form of economic activity that ears you income so it's a yes or no question so since I said currently not employed so this is a no and then I'll put 0 because I'm not earning any money and then um are you economically independent no and then um how did you learn about young Africa I learned it through a

what if South Africa is on the verge of one of the biggest educational revolutions to date will we be ready for centuries education has remained static throughout the world with teachers teaching and Learners learning by sitting still and paying attention but this is changing as more and more people are reacting to the saying that if children don't learn the way we teach then we should teach the way they learn what if technology is about to change education in South Africa what if the book is being replaced as the primary means of written knowledge transfer Howell Publishers react will we be ready MacMillan we believe it's time for this to happen and we are ready my name is and I'm the publishing director of Macmillan as Educators we often work with one another and think about what is the purpose of teaching and learning it is about conveying information to Learners to students in the classroom in the lecture halls in a way that is understandable to them and that is what the important thing is what Educators through the years have actually always known is that in order to teach effectively children need to be able to learn and that is a whole different thing from just standing in front of the classroom or standing in front of the lecture hall we often need to make learning sexy for children it's always been that way so your textbook is wonderful your overhead projectors anything that you may use is a wonderful technique these days we know that technology is all over and children have easy access to technology and information is readily available and that is what needs to come into the classroom so there's nothing wrong with teaching with a textbook and using all the old favorite methods that really work but for Learners who are going home and exploring their iPad or looking or browsing on the internet for kids who are on Facebook they're on mix it for kids who prefer ebooks for kids who like their cell phones and they're all like their cell phones somehow we need to distract them from those media that they are using and find a way to make learning sexy once again so we just are Reinventing the wheel at schools like Sunwood Park where they have decided to go completely digital we were able to provide them all our textbooks that have been caps approved in digital format so we gave them ePub formats where you will see later on you're able to highlight you're able to annotate you're able to add additional stuff and so it actually functions very much like a textbook with your notebook next door to you so it's all in on one device and that school has found that particular format very useful what started out as a dream has now become a reality with MacMillan being on board our Educators Learners and parents have engaged in technology at Sonic Park High School we have become a fully compliant e-learning school and we are the Front Runners in the country at the moment please bear in mind we are a model C and A government School in other places like false Bay College what we're doing is working with them to take their materials that they are have purchased from MacMillan and to further develop those activities so they can put them into their learning management system which they operate through Blackboard other colleges do it through Moodle so what you do is that in those colleges the Learners are able to do their assessments remotely no matter where they are at home on the train on the way to work at the college they actually submit their assessments on the device which is sometimes as easy as a cell phone and the teacher or the lecturer will actually Mark those things and give feedback to the Learners on that same device by now you must be really excited about the possibilities of including digital learning in your classroom in your lecture hall and wondering about how you can do it and that is where MacMillan comes in because unlike a lot of Publishers we don't just give you the ebooks we'll come to you and say to you what do you need and based on your needs analysis we'll be able to help you come up with a solution we work with a number of Partners who can assist you with Hardware who can assist you with budgeting you can assist you with insurance you can assist you with connectivity with a particular provider they literally assist you to create the entire business plan should you do that so we do have access to a number of possibilities a number of partners that can help make this as painless as possible from A to Z it's time it's time to embrace change to help you once again to fulfill the purpose of teaching and learning in your classrooms and in your lecture hall MacMillan will be there with you every step of the way no project is too big or too small whether you're an education department official a lecturer a principal a head of Department an individual child a private organization an NGO or a parent we're there for you MacMillan making cover solutions to all your challenges in the classroom macmillan's highly successful talking stories electronic books are also being redesigned to work on tablets and phones it contains stories that are read out loud while the words are highlighted on the screen for the child to see interactive activities that are based on the stories being read out loud are included for the children to practice and test their knowledge these stories and activities are based on macmillan's Foundation phase reading books which cover all aspects of the South African curriculum available in English Afrikaans isi Corsa and isizulu many schools have already seen the value of these readers with over 400 Western and Eastern Cape schools installing these readers as part of their teaching AIDS MacMillan have recently partnered with mindset to bring the learn extra life lessons to Learners which is based on the MacMillan textbooks with these shows being broadcast Monday to Thursday from 4 to 7 pm I'm Kirsty Macadam and I'm a publishing manager here at Macmillan we're very excited about our partnership with mindset because for us it means that Learners and teachers who use our books will get an extra lesson every week in maths maths literacy Life Sciences physical sciences and business studies the shows are live and interactive so that Learners can ask questions on the various social media platforms such as Facebook and mix it and even over email and they can get answers immediately these shows are broadcast on DStv and top TV and in addition they are recorded and loaded onto YouTube for later viewing or downloading along with lesson notes South Africa there is a big hype about ebooks in schools and colleges and understandably so they can be put on one device that is easy to carry around in addition e-books can contain video clips animation and links to other resources Learners can highlight text and add notes and look up words in the dictionary all our caps books are available as ebooks MacMillan is also looking to the Future within you website design and welcome Seegers I'm the digital publisher at MacMillan the new website's been designed to Showcase everything that MacMillan has to offer our textbooks for schools our textbooks for fet colleges and international schools also many resources like the graded readers the novels the dictionaries and also our guidelines also our teacher workshops and courses and especially our ebooks visitors will be able to browse all our eBooks online and then immediately purchase and download them for viewing what this means is that not only are we able to sell ebooks directly to the public but it gives our booksellers a platform to sell ebooks because many of them don't have the infrastructure to do so so you can now find information on any of our products and services very easily online and it uses the latest responsive design so it looks good on a computer on a tablet on a phone on any device MacMillan wants to encourage Learners and teachers to engage with them on social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter why is it that in some parts of our school we're not choose MacMillan books but we use in caps this caps thing has got nothing to help me but it only brings failure please help thanks Looney we're so glad to hear you like them they are available on the national catalog so ask your teacher to order them for next year don't forget you can download all the show notes from www.learnxtra.co.za forward slash live to get more practice the approved MacMillan books for the Caps curriculum are available speak to your teacher about ordering these books for your school our marketing team is visiting schools now we do not know what tomorrow's technology will bring but MacMillan will continue to offer quality teaching and learning material in whatever format the education sector needs the time is now and we are ready
f my students too so i think you reiterated it excellent thank you great yeah and there's always going to be the need for follow-up with individuals and that's where some of those other tools might uh come in um before we get to that i want to mention um the well i want to talk about zoom first actually um you will have a zoom page in your course are are you all going to be using zoom this spring for one for one purpose or another okay so whether it's a synchronous class meeting or office hours or whatever else you can schedule your class meetings right in here if you want to this interface is going to be the same as uh if you might schedule meetings in your zoom account the difference is your students can see this your students can see anything you put here so if you want a there's there's two kind of approaches i've seen to this um one of them is you create one meeting with one link that you use all the time for this particular class or one link that you use all the time for all your courses and you put that link somewhere obvious you know your home page or what have you uh the second approach um is doing a recurring meeting that is particular to each course i think there's benefits to both if you do say your personal meeting room all the time that makes it easy to copy the link and put it everywhere for people who need it the advantage of doing a unique meeting is that well your students will be able to see the schedule here and it would prevent things like students from other classes accidentally popping in too early to a class that's in progress or popping into office hours when uh you're you know talking to somebody where you might need more privacy and that kind of thing so um that's a good point if you have multiple classes then i would definitely what dan's talking about is have them start a half an hour apart or something in case there's you know overlap conversation or something so that or someone's coming 15 minutes early because you always got that one person in the class who likes to be super super early um so i think the overlap can happen so i would if you've got multiple courses have have that built in where there's some downtime on your zoom for that whether it's a half an hour or whatever and for yourself because you know zoom burnout is real get up get coffee whatever in between that's right uh that's all i wanted to say there uh so again that's that's a page you can either use or or not in your course and if you don't use it i would definitely hide it from your menu um grade center this uh could be its own conversation but we're going to try to cover the very basics and chris i don't want to forget about talking about importing either your grade center when you click on grades is going to be a break spreadsheet i think you probably all know just a couple notes here if you click on view and hit statuses this is the legend for the color coding that you might see on the spreadsheet blue is late missing is red uh resubmitted is green dropped is the yellowish so um those are things you might encounter um there are a lot of little nuances with the grade center that are often a case of uh well give us a call if if something is frustrating you for more than five minutes it's probably a simple fix but we want to be sure it's not going to um you know cause the student undo stress or anything like that so uh if you ever have a question about what's going on in the grade center feel free to give us a call speed grader we wanted to mention too uh lots of things going on here too on traditional assignments we certainly encourage you to make use of the things that you're seeing here in line feedback the tools up here called point annotation or the highlighter these are examples of each where you can point to a particular section of the paper or passage to draw their attention to it and give them very specific feedback this option is only available with assignments not quizzes or discussions or other things rubrics on the other hand are available for uh more types of assignments so um that is a great place to provide particular feedback uh rubrics also make it uh easier to ensure that you are being thorough and consistent throughout your class particularly if you have a if you have a big class greg we talked to one of your colleagues this afternoon who was talking about a class of a hundred um that's a case where i would argue it's more important to have rubrics in a situation like that where you might be doing a lot of grading spending a lot of time in the grade center here making sure that people are are getting consistent feedback and um that that you are being consistent over the course of grading in an assignment down below here are some other cool features you can add general comments by typing in here you can also add video video comments uh by recording yourself just as you might in zoom or studio you can add yourself providing feedback in in an audio and video kind of way just uh just to mix it up that's good to see occasionally you can talk faster than you type so for the time saving benefit you might want to take advantage of that and it also provides that additional connection to the student you know letting them hear your voice uh see your face a little more frequently the final option here is a talk to text tool it's pretty accurate um you're going to want to double check that for acronyms and particularly in a discipline like pharmacy you want to double check the accurate accuracy of things like that but um for the most part you know if you click the button you know you just tell it what it want what you want to say and it'll turn it into uh text here okay that was very quick but i want to get to one more thing which was course copying so if you've got a new course for the spring it's going to be a big empty slate uh before it has anything in it and again that's where you're going to see this giant alphabetical list of options here that you're going to want to filter um but for the purposes of getting new content into it you might be building it from scratch um but in most cases you're probably going to be copying over content from another faculty member or from your own fall or spring course in those cases this button here on the right is what you need import existing content so again we are in the course we are in the spring course the one uh that you need the content in so we're importing and you've got a bunch of options here if you're bringing it over from blackboard you're going to want something like this but if you're copying from a different canvas course you're going to want the top option here copy a canvas course right here it's going to ask you to type in the name of that older course for example if we want uh if we're doing a pharmacy course um okay you just start typing it in and it's going to pull up everything you are an instructor in so any course that exists uh you'll be able to uh show have show up on this list you can also type in the crn i believe yes uh so if you've got that you can type that in um it's well i'm um just because i'm an administrator it's pulling up everything in the university which is why we need to be specific so once you've selected your course you'll have some more options down here in most cases you're going to want all content you can adjust the due dates if you like what this will do is you kind of give it some parameters the old course starts at uh such and such a date and it ends on this date and oops the new semester starts here and ends here it's going to do a best guess at you know based on your old due dates it'll it'll take a guess at what the new due dates should be that is really nice by the way it is it is uh but it comes with the caveat that uh you know you always want to double check it because i found that its accuracy is is never 100 so uh do double check that kind of stuff but it is a great tool um after that hit import and down here the process is going to run and it'll let you know when it's done after that you'll start to see your stuff pop into these areas over here your menu is going to rearrange based on the older course so it will pull in the arrangement uh from your older course at that same time um do be sure to double check um particularly if uh it's coming from blackboard uh blackboard has a habit of including a lot of junk that you don't need assignment groups uh in particular redundant assignments um you probably might have assignment groups called total or something like that that kind of stuff can be deleted uh it's all just kind of uh extra blackboard stuff that is not necessary in canvas so if you've got a blackboard course that you've taught many many times you're probably better off just building it the first time in canvas without all the back files and all the stuff that's still saved that you don't even remembers in there yeah that that's so true as as unfortunate as as that truth is it's uh you know just to be sure that everything is clean and working the way you want building it from scratch is uh you know and it's a not to be uh dismissed out of hand it's a good option okay i have a question yes please what i'm doing is i've got to say this right dr ing taught the class i'm teaching on campus last semester and i'm teaching in grand rapids and she has put me on her course so that i can copy and use what i wish and there are some changes she's made to the course so what i do i import her whole course and then delete what i want and then add what i want or do i start with my own first i would recommend option one there okay and her course first yep yep bring everything in to yours um so you can play with it without messing anything up for her um and then just as you said delete what you don't need and add additional things as as you do is it easy to delete oh yeah oh yeah okay um everything for uh in terms of deleting uh everything is kind of accomplished through the three dots on the right edge of most things so we can do that for items and we can do that for modules as well and you might you might have noticed there if it's a module it says delete if it's an item here it says remove and you remember that's because the thing does not live here this is just a link to the thing if you have an assignment that you need to delete you need to go to the assignments page here so this is where the actual thing lives and if you click on it here now it says delete so that's how you know you're actually getting rid of the thing good point you would suggest that i delete through that assignment page then if i'm not deleting the whole module correct yeah if you just need to get rid of individual items do it on the assignments page okay the difference of that is if you made changes you like and then you copied the course in it'll erase all your you know or add it in funky places so if you just first get the whole course the old course in then you can modify it and you won't lose anything that way i mean otherwise you can bring it in in pieces but i'll take forever compared to just a full course copy and then fix it the way you like it that's the fastest route well i do want to thank you all for joining today we're at five o'clock um so i
 take I'm love with you don't ch  I want to I want hello friends and colleagues good morning if people could uh please find a seat I know there are sort of a scarcity of seats in here but I do see a couple Empty Chairs up here at the front so please uh take a seat and and join us for this session I'm really pleased today to have the opportunity to moderate uh this plenary session at e-learning Africa 20124 uh today we are going to be speaking about navigating the future transformative strategies for education training and skills development in Africa we have a fantastic panel lined up today to share perspectives from throughout the continent and also at the global level I need to inform you that unfortunately the permanent secretary from Rwanda is unable to join us today that's okay though because it's going to allow us more time for exchange for questions and for discussion so we will bring in questions and comments uh at the end and looking forward to a sort of vibrant discussion uh this this morning also I wanted to say that unfortunately my counterpart at UNICEF Frank van Capel can also not be with us at the last minute so he is uh replaced here uh by his colleague Charles who's the education Chief in Rwanda and Charles is going to start uh us off today by saying a few words about the UNESCO UNICEF Global initiative gateways to public digital learning Charles the floor is yours okay go to the okay thought we can uh thank you Mark uh good morning it's late afternoon right it's afternoon everybody uh my name is Charles savalino I'm the chief of Education as Mark s in Rwanda uh my colleague Frank who has been working on this uh Initiative for a long time it's not able to make it unfortunately but I will be able to say a few words and I will pass it over to um a little bit for uh additional information to mark because this is a global initiative um the the Gateway it's it's it's a global initiative that is also applicable the regional level and it's it's the intention is to make um you know Learning Gateway for public learning in a dig a global initiative that UNICEF and uh UNESCO has uh LED uh to make sure that the governments and partners all over the world and and regionally make digital content available uh so that children um can have the opportunity to learn uh the same way as you know they would have the opportunity to learn when they go to schools so in terms of how things have evolved over the years since this initiative was launched in 2022 at the UN General Assembly uh I have a few examples that I can do but I'll pass it over to Mark to say additional but I know that the process has already kicked off in Egypt recently there was an important meeting that took place where Partners were able to learn from each other and share experiences both in what is working and what is not working well so that when they go back to their uh their countries they can they can uh learn from those experiences so maybe Mark you can say a little bit more about the Gateway so then I'll pick up from that point if there's any additional information thank you great thank you so much Charles um so again unfortunately uh Charles's counterpart at unisa Frank van Capel cannot be here but I I wanted to share a little bit about uh what Frank was prepared to say and he was going to speak about a technology that was radically new in human history it was marvelous in many ways but it was also dangerous it was giving rise to Torrance of misinformation it was polarizing societies on sensitive issues of immigration religion and race it was regularly used to spread hate and amplify anger it allowed people to feel like they knew celebrities and fueled celebrity worship it gave unremarkable and often uned educated people with fringe ideas Regional and even National followings it captivated children and adults alike many people said its grip on people's attention bordered on addiction parents said it was distracting from and often undermining education it was spreading false information about health including information about a deadly and highly contagious influenza virus it was often used to convince reasonable people of outlandish things such as one instance when an entire country became convinced that there was an alien invasion that an alien invasion of Earth was underway Bad actors used it to commit Financial crimes and fuel Ponzi schemes it was elevating the voice of authoritarian leaders who disdained democracy and sharing power what had looked at first glance like a technology that would Propel Humanity to new heights was in many ways tearing our societies apart you all know the technology I'm speaking about right I'm speaking about the radio people genuinely did not know what to do it started to look like this new technology ology might not carry us to a bright future but a very dark one any guesses which country had more radios per capita than any country in the world in the 1930s it was Germany and we all know the horrors that came in the 1940s in the USA also in the 1930s more than 30 million people would tune in to pro Hitler hate speing radio broadcast of father Charles Caan a Detroit priest who was turning American democracy on itself is some of that starting to sound familiar people were so worried there were major movements to ban the new technology to block or to heavily regulate the Airways and spectrums on which this new radio technology depended but a pioneering group of people including intellectuals technologists educators ERS and government authorities became convinced that the solution was not Banning the new technology but harnessing its magical capabilities to advance the public good and what was that Innovation it was public radio first with the BBC and then public broadcasters began rolling out and scaling up in countries around the world these Innovations are still with us today the mission statements of most public broadcasters are to educate first to inform second and to entertain third when the TV was invented and spread like wildfire around the world public broadcasters were right behind them they helped ensure this technology pointed us to a more informed educated and more floristic societies we saw the birth of educational TV broadcasts I myself am a beneficiary of Sesame Street which was aired in my small town in in Colorado where I'm from and I'm sure that many of you in this room remember public television broadcast that helped you to learn to understand how to live in a society with diversity but now I ask what of our what about our latest technological Marvel the internet and AI Technologies where are the public places and public content for public good on the internet we are 25 years I know it varies on countries but we are 20 25 years in some countries maybe 15 years into a digital Revolution and we're at a real folks where there is often no public place for public education on the internet we can fix this we've done it before and that is what this initiative that we run with UNICEF is all about we are working with governments to help them to support education in online and digital mediums I think we can all agree that if there's an eighth grader who wants help in mathematics that eighth grader should have a clear place to go to get content to advance his or her education if there is a 10th grader who is studying biology it should be very clear where that person can go to get educational content we did an analysis with UNICEF we looked at how many countries even have public digital learning platforms many countries do not many countries did launch small scale initiatives to start public digital learning platforms during co9 but in our analysis at least a third of those platforms have since been shut down and are no longer supported so I'm going to use the rest of this time to just give a little bit of an overview about what the gateways initiative is and how we want to work with all of you to help ensure that when students teachers and families cross the digital line they are still supported there is still public education this slide is probably not unfamiliar to anybody in this room we know that we need these three key ingredients to make digital learning a reality we need connectivity we need capacities and we need content a lot of the times the discussions about digital learning unfortunately stop and end with connectivity we know that many people are unconnected and this is an urgent problem that needs to be solved and there are a lot of global initiatives meant to help ensure Universal connectivity there's an entire un organization called itu that's dedicated to this Mission this is a mission though that falls outside the Mandate and the authority of public education officials when it comes to capacity capacity of course concerns education but it also transcends it people need digital skills and capacity for reasons of Health for all sorts of different reasons it's something that includes education but goes well beyond it but what about content content Falls fully under the authority of Education officials this is something that we as Educators and as technologists can do right we can ensure that public education is supported online and in digital spaces and that's what our initiative is all about what challenges do we address many different challenges we know that the current reality is yes there is educational content online however it often sits behind pay walls and is very expensive to access we know that it often requires very high bandwidth which we know that our students and teachers do not always always have they often have intermittent connectivity we further know that a lot of the free applications are not in fact free they're sucking up students data they're an incursion into their privacy we know that a lot of the content that's available now it comes from only a handful of countries and it does not reflect the cultural diversity of our societies nor the linguistic diversity finally we know that a lot of this content does not accommodate students with learning or physical disabilities and public digital learning content can can and should do a much better job of supporting that we believe that public digital content should be like fashia bread which is delicious if you have not tried it it's like pizza without cheese we use this as just an acronym to help understand what we think the main pillars of excellent content should be it should be findable it should be free a lot of lot of countries do have some public digital learning platform or content but nobody knows it exists so it's not used so findable is is key free of course organized curriculum aligned accessible controlled current means it's kept up to datee it is instructive and pedagogically appropriate and it is adaptable and changeable using what is great about a digital medium which Textbooks For example could not do we're concerned with content but we focus on platforms why do we focus on platforms we focus on platforms because platforms are what make content findable and usable there is content everywhere on a YouTube channel on a WhatsApp group on this website over here platforms can bring that content under a single roof and help Learners teachers and families find what they need efficiently and quickly it can also create a space where people are sure they are safe that the content is going to be quality controlled that the content is going to be age appropriate that the content reflects National values and and Moors I also want to underscore the point that we at UNESCO and UNICEF do not Envision a world where these digital Technologies are going to replace schools and universities we know that vital work happens at schools socialization acculturation we wrote an entire book called an edtech tragedy which I presented actually here two years ago to explain what happens in a world without schools it's not good so we see these digital learning platforms not as working to circumnavigate schools which is often what a lot of digital content is trying to do and instead work to improve and enrich the important work that happens in schools finally we believe our initiative is aligned with a lot of the standard setting documents coming out of un organizations and that have been agreed by your countries here in Africa and countries around the world you see slides up here of the UN secretary General's road map on digital cooperation the coming Global digital Compact and a number of other standard setting documents that call for more digital Commons digital content that advances the public good and where else is a more powerful place to establish digital Commons and Advance the public good than in education so our gateways initiative I think you understand the rationale I hope you understand its importance we feel it's extremely important what are we doing we have three core components that we are working with your countries to do the first is we want to establish a map that shows where digital learning platforms exist and help to share information about them for those of you sitting at your tables think for a moment I did this yesterday think if you can of two countries that neighbor your own just in your head two countries You' got them in your head two countries the Border your country now I would like you to to ask yourself do you know the public digital learning platform used in those countries you were all edtech Specialists this is our our field our job and I myself I don't either because there's no information there's no information about this but if I ask you to name the public radio broadcaster you might know the public television station you might know but we don't know for public digital learning it's important because when we can see what is available and we can learn about it we can be inspired we can we can build our platforms better we can look at what our neighbors are doing in countries halfway around the world and understand the innovations that are happening in this space innovations that are often driven by the public sector not just the private sector that's component one component two is about helping countries as Charles mentioned learn and share together how do we do this every month we feature the experience of a particular platform through a webinar it's just a 90 minute tight webinar we looked at Egypt we looked at Uruguay we're going to be looking at countries every single month to share the experiences they have learned lessons that they have drawn things they wish they had done differently things they're planning for the future very valuable for everybody in this room we also do study visits and this is where we bring people together in Person Public officials responsible for public digital learning platforms to share their experiences and lessons that they have learned in their National context I just was in Egypt about 10 days ago to do a study visit with about 23 countries that we assembled in Cairo and we were learning about the Egyptian knowledge Bank this is a public digital learning platform that now benefits tens of millions of people across Egypt Egyptians all recognize it teachers use it it's a fantastic public resource for education and they shared what lessons they have learned they shared the mistakes they have made made and they shared what their sort of future plans are on top of that they offered to share content and technology that had been developed in Egypt with their neighbors they have a lot of excellent Arabic language content they offered to share it with others so gateways is a platform for this sharing and Interstate cooperation around public digital learning finally we host an annual gathering at UNESCO called digital learning week we will be meeting from the from the 2nd to the 5th of sep September this year and sharing ideas about public digital learning platforms that's component number two finally the last component it's about norms and standards if I ask people in this room what is a public digital learning platform I'm probably going to get a lot of very different answers we want to establish some sort of orientation and guidance about what are the key things that should be in a public digital learning platform and I think that fasha um you know that that that analogy that we used with the with with free and open curriculum aligned these are some of the the signposts that we want to establish with these norms and standards so slide's not clicking anymore I leave you with that there's information about this on the UNICEF website on the UNESCO website and we are asking countries to join this initiative joining is very simple you you fill out a template letter you send it to UNESCO and UNICEF and you are part of this Global Community to ensure that when we meet here again at e-learning Africa in 5 years I hope there's not a country in the world that doesn't have a vibrant public digital learning platform we need to reclaim the possibilities of the internet and harness them for the public good and for public education it's a common sense Choice thank you very much I'm sorry that I have to wear wear two hats here a moderation hat and a speaking hat but it's now my pleasure to introduce our next speaker uh it's m Jenny Tamara Manda M Jenny is an entrepreneur and a student of geoinformatics in Zimbabwe and she is going to be sharing her story with all of this and a bit of about the way uh her education has helped her as well as technology monen the podium is [Applause] yours okay can you imagine I become a technical expert in just two years what do you think I will be if I act the access to technology in 23 years we don't know ladies and gentlemen honorable guest all protocols observed thank you very much for this opportunity let me first thank uh Rebecca and your team I never imagined standing in front of people like what I'm doing today uh it was always my dream to be in front of people listening to me actually I was born in shugui a a small town 23 years ago in shugi societal expectations have impacted girls dreams lives expectations and opportunities girls are expected to get married as soon as they finished high schools emancipation of girls has never been achieved in my community girls are expected to be mothers they expected to have families no one ever wished to see a girl being a CEO being a director having your own company okay okay ladies and gentlemen girls are dropping out of school engaging in sexual activities named sex workers All In Love of Money shugu town is a mining town and Mining activities are a source of living boys are dropping out of  school boys are dropping out of school engaging illegal gold mining activities for them to gain money but is what is money without knowledge mining activities not only are affecting the social life of people but also affecting the economic life of people in UGI mining activities are contributing to Global Climate Change impacts of course we blame the global north of these climate change impacts but we also contributing by the activities that we are doing ladies and gentlemen I can say it all started warm the people you associate with the surroundings impact your future I can say and blessed to have supportive parents the parents that always wishes me to have a better life to change to challenge the societal Norms not only that but in all my life I have met mentors mentors that always encouraged me to push to have a better and different mindset when I was um at the end of my high school my geography teacher encouraged me to follow the path that I am unfortunately I didn't know that degree that the degree I'm doing was more technical than what I thought because when I applied I just liked the Environmental Conservation part but I didn't know that it's more of geoinformatics using the technical skills to solve the environmental issues to my surprise I wasn't exposed to technology and this was my first time to see a laptop because in my high school we didn't have laptops I got in enrolled at know invest of Technology during the covid-19 era things were not going as expected like I have said I never saw a laptop but I was enrolled in a technical degree how am I going to do that and the most communication I was exposed to at this phone and I have to use a laptop to start with ladies and gentlemen what I can say is mentors are important of course my geography teacher was a teacher but she had a mentorship mindset if you want Africa to be on another stage we need to have teachers we have mentorship mindset of course you didn't make it as a teacher but you have to teach the ladies you have to teach the children to be more than what you achieved ladies and gentlemen I believed that education will be a way to my success however we know in Africa we have limited resources and it's very difficult for one to grab what everything that I needed and um as soon as covid-19 era finished I then went back to school I started seeing reality ladies and gentlemen I didn't know how to start with to start with a word document of which my degree is technical I have to do coding I have to do um machine learning but I don't know how to uh create a Word document it wasn't easy for me ladies and gentlemen but um I utilized all the platforms that I thought could help me the teachers at school saw a potential in me and they always encouraged me to look for initiatives that could improve my experience ladies and gentlemen I started engaging in student clubs doing collaborations and partnership with different organizations we were doing um the legs we were doing webinars we're doing a trainings all these to gain experience because I knew the problem at school that we only have 14 desktops of which about 400 students I don't have my personal laptop and at school we have limited laptops and all these initiatives attending the workshops learning from experts in the industry already helped me to improve the experience my capabilities and ladies and gentlemen it might look funny but I started doing projects for people I started helping students to do their dissertations their thesis improving my technical skills every day I started selling myself to different companies and people started call me calling me Madam CEO and to to I realize that one needs it's not always about the teacher but also us as students we need to play our part we need to to invest not only in just not only investing in um not only investing in Financial Resources but investing in self-belief I utilized platforms like LinkedIn to build a strong Support Network most of the people under mine Linked In but you never know what you post you might just post that uh um I'm so happy to share that I've been this is my first time to be at the airport someone might be uh motivated and look how you did it ladies and gentlemen as students we also need to look out for the opportunities do not just be ideal and hope for the best nothing comes on a silver platter you have to work it's not always about the part of the teachers but also us as students we need to play our role in building a strong support network I always hear people saying in Africa there are no jobs but the problem is as students we want to look for jobs after school of which it's not possible because there are a lot of competitions you need to create connections you need to connect while least you at school uh as you know ladies and gentlemen we are in Africa and things don't go as we expect we have limited resources we have high sanctions High Cost of Living and at some point I started facing school fees challenges I couldn't bance unfortunately my father retired um in 2010 that's 10 14 years ago and things the money he's getting is not enough to CER for my expenses I'm I'm spending more than 1,000 years a semester and he is earning less than $100 and things started going tough I thought of defa deferment at some point but uh I utiliz the skills that I had I had developed I started doing projects for people I started engaging with different organization doing projects for different people earning some money um fortunately the outfit that I'm wearing today I bought it by the money that I did [Applause] um sometimes as girls we lack self-confidence we we lack uh we don't believe in ourselves um being in a m dominated field J informatics Environmental Conservation sometimes you would feel that you are not fitting in here I remember during attachment I was I was attached at Anglo American at a mine and 3/4s of the people were male and only a quarter were female and sometimes I couldn't have the confidence to to talk to the man and have decisions but um I thank God because I met mentors and coaches during my attachment those people sometimes they would um dedicate tasks that were very hard to me and sometimes I would think oh do they want me to lose 50 k of which I weigh less than 50 kg but I realized it was a way of mentoring me encouraging me to push to have a positive mind different from the one imagine if I didn't get this opportunity I would be a mother of 10 kids by now but uh I thank God I met mandles who always pushed me to have a different mindset to have to push in this male dominated field um this field really needs someone who's muscular unfortunately I'm not but I always um get the opportunity to meet people who encourages me to push forward mentorship um has been one of the most important factors that helped me to move forward to push to to be um to have a different mindset from the people um of my community okay okay um ladies and gentlemen um what's next for me um I'm exactly I'm completing my undergrads degree next month that's [Applause] um so in in my final [Laughter] year okay um in my final year I did a projects of quantifying forest cover um Forest cover loss and Forest carbon sequestration potential in a mining area I wanted to see how much impact is deforestation doing to the people doing to the community because we know trees are carbon singers and if you cut the cut down those trees we are contributing to Global um climate change impact so that was my project and um submitting it on Monday [Laughter] and I also have an intention of establishing um a GIS and climate um initiative why because you teach what you know and I'm going to teach because I now know and I believe I now know and the knowledge that I now have will be enough to teach the people in my community people are doing degradation they're cutting down trees but they don't know the reason then they know why we should conserve our resources so I want to spread awareness to my community members not just my community members but in Africa so that people are aware of the activities that are doing and lastly I have a desire to pursue a master's degree if fans permit and mostly I want to I'm motivated this to change my family status unfortunately no one in my family has ever gone to University and I'm the first person so so I want to change my family status that we can do it Ginger does doesn't matter we can do it and I want to challenge the societal Norms that girls can be CEOs girls can be managers girls can be directors girls can be Leaders of Tomorrow [Applause] I I always wanted to be my own boss so I think you should also start calling me Madam CEO um ladies and gentlemen in conclusion today I stand confident that education really empowers innovation I am a testimony of that and ladies and gentlemen investing in skills really fuels dreams let together let's Embrace diversity and innovate Africa thank you [Applause] wow Madame CEO wow I told I told mugami we had a long conversation yesterday I said I'm happy to be speaking to you now because I think in the future it's going to be difficult I'm going to have to go through secretaries and various uh department heads and other things so anyway if you want to speak to Mong you don't have to deal with three levels of secretaries at least not today but what a what a what an inspiring story and so remarkable that uh you know the first encounter with digital technology at age 21 and starting a business making money doing geospatial you know visualizations at age 23 a remarkable Testament to the power of education and how quickly people can come to master these Technologies and turn them into entrepreneurial opportunities thank you so much Mong they very very [Applause] inspiring I'd like to now introduce our next speaker uh it is uh Mr Rogers um sitole and Rogers is a entrepreneur uh and chairman of one connect Rogers the floor is yours thank you [Applause] what an amazing young lady Madame CEO wow thank you so much uh ladies and gentlemen distinguished guests um thank you so much for allowing me to be in your presence today um all protocol observed my name is Roger sitole as Mar has indicated um I should have said San bonani um I'm from South Africa um I'm a founder and chairman of one connect as M has also uh indicated one connect is a 15y old baby I said a baby yesterday and someone said it's not a baby that it's 15 years old so it's a 15y old teenager Tech teenager um which is U an African born organization we have got presence in the continent uh with specific physical offices in South Africa mosambi in Muto Nairobi Kenya servicing the continent it's been a privilege uh for me to uh be part of of of this company I am an African Child uh born bred in the continent uh schooled in the continent qualified in the continent um so yeah our education system is not that bad is it f fun fact about me uh I'm a father of five um two set of [Applause] twins um boy girl boy girl and a little buer who decided to come and mess up our piece we were we were happy until young Alexander came to life um just like many African children like myself we have faced grew up in many challenging uh circumstances uh Mong shared her experiences I mean she only had access to a computer a couple of years ago um many kids in the continent still um suffer uh through these challenging um experiences an amazing story was shared Yesterday by Francis bizza whom INSP insired me dearly uh his story as an African traveling teacher inspired me to want to do better and do more uh I'm not quite sure about you but I was really I made some notes say uh I perhaps need to get up of my Laurels and do and do something better we quite privileged some of us and we do not uh understand the challenges that exist within the continent now I was fueled uh by the need to break the cycle of poverty that exists uh that existed in my family at least and um with great support from uh from my father and mother um I was able to go to school uh my father and mother understood that education was the great equalizer um for for me to to bridge the the poverty Gap in my first year of University unfortunately Ely for us for our family my dad was uh retrenched and at that time I had a decision to make as the eldest boy in the family to go look for I can't say for employment but go look for a job look for something to do uh to bring uh money and food into the family my father quickly dealt with me uh he reminded me that he was the man of the house and he was the father of the house I was only but a boy and my responsibilities were that to go to school and I obeyed and I obliged and I went to school there's nothing about my story like I said there's nothing special about it um but perhaps what might be special is just that desire um that I I had now covid came and um exposed the Gap that existed and the equal inequalities that exist within our society um many many quoted Nelson Mandela uh that he spoke about the importance of education on how it can change the world but what Co did is many uh people um suffered through this uh UNESCO indicates that uh 40 weeks of teaching and learning were lost during this period but if you think about who that 40 weeks impacted the most are exactly those that needed that education the most and they were set back quite um quite a lot now I spoke about challenges that exist in the continent uh these are some of the challenges that you're seeing on the screen I come from South Africa who some might indicate that it's a better development economy in the continent but even in South Africa we struggling with load shedding with electricity challenges um and you know that that's perverse as well across the whole continent I had a privilege of walking into a Minister's office in one country in the continent and I saw a picture similar to the one there and I looked at the picture and I had Nostalgia and I was taken back saying wow I cannot believe that those used to be the days and the minister quickly responded to me and said that's an actual schoo
 um in a specific part uh not even in the rural areas it was quite an urban area and I was taken a back about the fact that we still have ladies and gentlemen kids within our society that go to school Under the trees in situations like the ones you are seeing on the screen now we could uh look at that and say oh Rogers did you come here just to depress us I apologize if you feel depressed but that's not the intent no the intention um as Africans we're quite resilient uh my aim is to show a proof point I am privileged to be that proof Point um in that today I was able to rise from the dusty streets of my country where I grew up amongst the poverty that surrounded me within the challenges that we're facing and be able to have this privilege of standing in front of an amazing crowd and share my story that's what I want you to know I want you to know that as a continent this beautiful continent a young continent a fast developing continent we have got the ability and the capability to take our role not only as Leaders of our continent but also as leaders in the world Dr Lila spoke about that that we need to be um exporting um our skills in Africa to the rest of the world now how do we do that um I've I've always spoken about this Vision that I have and my vision ladies and gentlemen is to democratize education in this beautiful continent and every time I make that statement I say it's such a political statement to make and I am no politician I'm merely a businessman but what that statement means to me is that we need to ensure that each and every single child within the continent gets access to good underlying quality education independent of their location within the continent independent of their stage of life where they may be independent of their financial status independent of their gender independent of their disabilities they need to have access to good quality education but also they need to have access to a good support system the reason that I was able to succeed because I had parents that understood the importance of Education we have got a responsibility ladies and gentlemen to um be that support system to young people like uh Madame coo Madame CEO we have a responsibility uh to take people like her and be able to mentor and help uh become the next leaders of this beautiful continent of ours now further to democratizing education as how do we democratize this education there needs to be a great change or shift in mindset we need to reimagine education it's incredible that we're trying in this day 2024 we talking about AI machine learning uh you know we're talking about data science we're talking about all these fancy things yet some environments are still using models and methods from 1970 1960 to train the workforce of tomorrow that cannot be that needs to be changed further we need to re um we need to Foster entrepreneurship we need to Foster entrepreneurship but also we need to support entrepreneurs of the continent thank you thank you now how do we do that and i' would like to challenge leaders policy makers those that are in positions of responsibility that you need to make a decision today to say I will support an African business it's very funny that I had a privilege of participating in the ministerial round table and one of the conversation that was had in the ministerial Round Table was was around the brain drain that is happening within the continent now that means skills in the continent are leaving the continent and leaving us with nothing now every single individual will be looking for what is best for their family they need to provide for their families and pro and if provisioning for their families exists outside in the world that's where they will go but if organizations and companies and businesses within our continent are supported guess where they will go they will be employed locally and we will not be having brain drain challenges but furthermore we have got a huge Unemployment uh problem within the continent and the only way we can eradicate that is by supporting small medium Enterprises within the continent supporting local businesses supporting African businesses that are going to be able to employ local people that's what we need to be doing we also need to ensure that our procurement policies wherever they are they are understanding of this challenge that exists within the continent and we need to be deliberate deliberate about it I had a I've got a little uh incident that I have had in the past where I had a a privilege to sit in front of a a CEO the joh Johannesburg Stock Exchange and in that conversation um we spoke about how the what he can do to assist us as an organization and he you know in his mind he was I think he was just sharing purely a good story that they were able to meet together and raised a billion Rands in one night and he could link me up with the people that were managing the fund and they could be able to assist one connect in getting that fund he did not expect the answer that he got from me because I responded and I said to him sir I really really appreciate that opportunity however respectfully I decline I do not want funds I need an opportunity within your organization for our company to provide services if we provide services as a business we are able to one we have got a reference customer that can be utilized elsewhere to procure more business two we are able to uh have sustainable income as a business and that makes us a going concern not be given money and then with a lot of strings that are attached to it and you're going to stifle Innovation you're going to stifle the growth of the business he looked at me and he was shocked to that but you know we're able to he was able to assist us in in moving forward um I I I thought the guys at the back will not mess me up with my slides but I guess okay but anyway so the the last part that I I wanted to speak about was the fact that African problems are to be solved by Africans we need African solutions for Africa am I being um am I making a statement that sounds um know we groupist or something like that no the rest of the world is already figure out some of the solutions to the challenges that we have CU I understand very well that some of the challenges that we have as a continent are not unique however they are particular so they need to be localized as much as we may engage uh International organizations International partners that can come and assist us it's going to be important and imperative that we also localize these solutions to the within the African context once more in closing my message is that of hope it's not a message of Doom and Gloom it's a message of Hope to other Bing entrepreneurs out there that it is possible to you uh Madam CEO it is absolutely possible I am an standing example of exactly that who has gone through those challenges and I'm proud today that through this beautiful event we are one of the Platinum sponsors of this event we've been a sponsor of this event for a few years now because we believe in what this event stands for and that is to democratize education in Africa I thank [Applause] you thank you so much Rogers for those uh those remarks democratizing education ensuring that uh digital solutions for Africa come from Africa and I think some of that resonates with uh what we've been saying at UNESCO and UNF as well that for when countries want to build these public digital learning platforms that this is an opportunity to give tenders and to give opportunities to businesses and content creators and technologists inside of countries rather than moving outside so this really resonated with me folks we're fortunate we have a little bit of time for exchange for discussion um so if you have a a question a comment a reaction we would like to invite that I'd like to ask that you keep it uh sharp and concise um so think if you have a question but I wanted to give the floor back to Charles given that Charles is the education specialist for Unicef here uh in Rwanda and Charles just any sort of reactions to some of the uh the speakers we have heard from the presentations we have heard over to you Charles thank you Mark maybe I can come hello um I I think I just want to once again also um congratulate CEO Madame CEO because as a teacher I think there's nothing that you can be very proud of beyond having you know somebody who really from the bottom if I can say as capitalized on the value and the importance and the equalizing effect of Education to rise to the top she's not reached the top she wants to reach even higher but it shows that education is really really critical it's it has to be Democratic I agree but without education it's it's impossible to identify Talent H to identify potential and to also benefit from you know potential of so I really want to congratulate you the other point I want to make is that you know Talent sometimes we know it's everywhere but it's something that is equal everybody has it the only challenge we have is that we don't know where and who has it but it's education that brings it out so if we really make education equal to everybody it's going to benefit everybody and technology has made it even much better as she has said um she use the tech techology even though the experience is only 2 years to so I think what we are just to link it to you know the Gateway if you don't make it through the public if you make it through the private service provision it's not going to reach everybody it's the public sector that has the responsibility that has the capacity the mandate to deliver for everybody so I think the Gateway it's that's where the gate is very important so if you want to De deliver content that is high quality that is meant to be for everybody for free it's only the public service that can provide that it's the public sector that can provide that so all the other actors need to support the public SE to make sure that technology reaches the the last corner of every country and I think that's that's what I can add thank you so much excellent thank you so much Charles so looking forward to uh to questions reactions feedback uh let's take a take a few in and then maybe we can direct them to some of our speakers I I see sir right here in the front uh gentleman in the in the middle and if we could move mics to uh these individuals so again sharp and concise sir thank you yeah thank you very much for the exciting presentations my name is nango I come from K and I teach chemical engineering my question goes to um sit and on one hand you talking about uh complaining about brain drain and on one hand you want young Africans to remain and develop the continent so how do we do the balance how do we deal with it thank you thank you for the question sir if we can move the microphone to the gentleman in the middle who had his hand up thank you and the in the middle thank you my name is Johannes um and U yeah I heard the term public digital learning um and uh we just heard about um yeah the public service provider um should be in in charge to solve the problem and um where is the Digital internet where can it be found in the internet so I'm I'm actually glad that you started your introduction with digital R sorry with um with radio today um because we have public broadcasters and we are looking for public digital um uh education provider so I think the very very near and close solution that we we haven't spoken about it is a digital radio the introduction of Digital radio because it can carry digital content into the last corner of every place in the world and um actually we we showing that here but I don't want to make advertising for my company I just want to to talk about that we talk about this great solution that that can be also very quick and is very cheap thank you thank you very much few other questions comments reactions ma'am the front thank you facilitator I am rud tiger secretary for skills audit and development in Zimbabwe I am very proud and as I listen to to Yang mongi I am very proud I would like to ask you what would you tell the girls in uh in shugi who today think it's actually easier to just hang out with a with a miner and make money which they think or they look like they're making more money than you are so there's a parallel lifestyle that is going on that seems very attractive to Young to young girls what would you tell them and Mr sto uh how do we create a new mindset given your discussion with the with the billionaire the usual answer from our entrepreneurs is yes I will take the money how do we create a mindset that we are entrepreneurs for good this is what we are going to do and there is there is this half entrepreneur half beggar mentality that I always come across uh among our our entrepreneurs whether young or old and uh my question for the Gateway project if you look at connect uh it was connectivity it was capacity it was content in government in my experience we have three different actors in their silos responsible the connectivity person is a Ministry of I City or something the content person is the Ministry of Education the capacity person is me in Ministry of skills and everyone thinks they have their own kingdom what strategies did you use to bring them together for a common project thank you thank you very much Madam for the question let's get one more question and then we'll hand it back to our panelist yeah ma'am in the in the back there uh I'm mildre from M University Kenya the to Mark uh maybe just could you help us understand Kenya is grappling with CBC as a new educational curriculum and I think uh it's a good idea but we lack the requisite skill set among the teachers because they were not trained for this as UNESCO is there something you can do to step in uh the upskilling of the teachers for the digital education to succeed in the CBC because it really is a need great thank you very much for that question I wanted to hand it back to some some of our panelists for reactions um one Jenny few questions for you especially from from your uh from your colleague from Zimbabwe please hello okay um firstly I think I would tell them that your money is the best spending your own money is the best there is nothing which is more enjoyable than having money that has no restrictions no rules and regulations being your own [Applause] boss and we we really know that these people that doing illegal gold mining activities One day things might change and you'll be a mother of 10 kids without money and at the same time poverty will show you the way so what I can tell them is let's change before it's too late thank you thank you um for for the questions I've got two Mark um one is the brain drain versus is um youth or people remaining in the continent to build a continent um actually I am my my messaging was that uh people need to remain in the continent to build a continent that was my messaging it's it's the brain drain is a phenomenon that is happening and remaining in the continent to build a continent is the solution but um that solution needs to be backed um by existence of opportunities if opportunities for employment do not exist within the continent uh survival says people are going to go to where they will be able to survive and as such it's crucial and important for us to to support local businesses and to make sure that we you know uh we build entrepreneurs in we forc entrepreneurship we build entrepreneurs in the continent we support them because ultimately what they will be doing is to ensure um that those skills are retained in the continent you know when you're in the aerplane um and and I never understood it by the way but when you're in the plane um they say you must put your mask first before you can help your child I find that very strange but you know if you think about it they're saying You must be alive first before you can help someone now as a continent for us to be able to export any skills to the rest of the world we need to make sure that we as a continent are sufficient we as a continent are okay we are alive as a continent then we'll be able to export our skills to the rest of the world that that is the first one the second one um from from the Ambassador thank thank you thank you ma'am for the question and your question is around mindset wow that's a that's a difficult question um around mindset but for me the the answer is on proof points uh we've got people that like to see first you know is it is it possible um and if all what they seeing around them is all the guys that have all the people young women young lady men and women that have tried to start their own businesses they are struggling they are they are having difficult time they are stressed and all if if that's all they see um then the moment a quick back comes in the moment an easy opportunity comes in they will go for it because we have created an environment uh in the continent that is difficult and not conducive uh for entrepreneurship it's not conducive for business and and I think it's incumbent on all of us here um to change that mindset and from a when I say we need to reimagine education we talk about Innovative Technologies today we're talking about the workforce of tomorrow now you have got the workforce of Tomorrow are going to be dealing with tech that we don't even understand today um and and it's going to be important and imperative for us ma'am that uh we support um that because we will continually if we don't do that we'll continually be importing um and then exporting money if you understand what I mean and we're going to need to support local businesses thank you for the question thank you so much Rogers Charles we we had a question about the you know the this interface you're you're very correct ma'am about you know building a great public digital learning content doesn't mean necessarily teachers are able and know how to use it that that interface to be able to use you know great digital learning content that is free open and accessible is something we're paying close attention to but I don't know Charles we were discussing that earlier did you want to respond yeah I think that's why it comes as a package right so without the digital skills you won't be able to make make use of these so even though different government entities have I think also the Madame from Zimbabwe say that have respon mandate for different areas it's still critical as role of the government to see I don't know whether anyone was here when they had the Innovation Africa um also Summit here where the focus was also to say as a government you need to have a vision so that the different entities be towards a collective if you don't have a digital Vision what do we want to use technology for as a government because there's several aspects of it so if that vision is created and then the the different arms of government will easily fit in because you can't have everything put in one place so if it's a curriculum Department that has a new um the CBC that requires digital skills then that has to be taken into consideration so I think think the leadership from the government I I want to add one more Point link to the um the brain drain aspect I think from the government side The Brain Drain issues is also the lack of vision the broader vision for instance here if you don't have institutions that is Strive to make things world class you know if for instance Rwanda I think Rwanda is already doing that and there's a there's a vaccine Institute coming up here so if you set up a vaccine Institute that is that provide services globally you know people are going to come even from Europe to go and work here so the brain drain can also work the other way so the environment the policy environment the leadership it's it's very critical also for that and that's why you you will yeah thank you very much Charles I also just wanted to respond sir you mentioned um Digital radio yes I think that we we don't even though we're an internet era an AI era we don't want to shut down any of these public content offerings we have built many people still rely on public radio for education for information also for entertainment same with television uh children around the world are being educated by public television I think it's now incumbent on us to ensure that there there is public resources and great public content that's available online and also through AI applications we've all looked at these sort of commercial AI applications what might a public AI model look like what sort of answers would that sort of model give probably accurate truthful and again in harmony with sort of national objectives and goals the permanent secretary from Z bway she mentioned the importance of intersectoral cooperation you're absolutely right those three C's often sit inside of different Ministries and I just wanted to note that while the gateways initiative is very focused on on the content SE we do have uh mechanisms uh we have a digital transformation collaborative at UNESCO a UNESCO Global education Coalition that is working to help Ministries work together and also collab cooperatively with the the public with the private sector to solve these sort of solutions and build these whole of government uh Solutions so that's a that's another um aspect I finally wanted to say that we have noticed at UNESCO that when countries build good public digital learning platforms the offerings of private providers get better they get more Innovative when you put the sort of the the middle bar if I may the public Bar High the sort of private offerings have to show more Innovation so this is something that a good public digital learning platform can rise all boats and I'll tell you also that I have never seen a public digital learning platform that is not working collaboratively with the private sector to behind the scenes they have all sorts of agreements and they're working with private sector companies to surface sort of the best content the most engaging content so I think this is something where every everybody wins if we have these if we're supporting public education and online and digital mediums we started a little late I want to take just a few more questions uh we'll take one more round but I'm looking at the table right here in the front and center because I know this is where uh government authorities some permanent secretaries people who are former ministers current ministers people thinking about education in a position to influence policy were there any questions or comments from the table in the front here excellent we have [Music] three [Music] [Music] for [Music] for for [Music] [Music] ACC [Music] [Music] [Music] uh [Music] [Music] Mercy ma'am from uh from Cameron please thank you very much I want to start by appreciating the speakers of this morning especially the CEO you are a force to reckon with and you are a model to display to our young girls in Africa the truth is thank you girls easily give up women even more but once they have the push and the role modeling that you are talking about they have the inner strength to overcome and you have shown by that example we have noticed in many of our countries that especially at the elementary and basic level where I operate that the need for training is very crucial the need for mentoring is very crucial and uh I dare say that we want to appreciate the work that UNESCO has been doing in Cameron to train our teachers the phobia is real for the teacher to be able to teach a little child in it that she or he himself has not mastered is a bit of a challenge but we think that gradually with the training teachers are overcoming this in our country also um we set up um it institutions which are open to the public when covid came it was a boost for Cameroon to really delve into it many of us got acquainted to our computers to our laptops because we had to communicate from home work had to continue school had to continue and since then we've kept our online classes going but I'm really so grateful that um the public platform that UNESCO is bringing is something that we need to engage in and of course when I get back I'll make sure that my Ministry is connected to UNESCO in this the problem that um she raised about several Ministries in charge of Education can be quite complicated in Cameroon there are four separate ministries of Education there's basic education there's secondary education there's higher education and there is vocational training the good thing is that all of them the government has a vision for digital growth in Cameroon therefore when we have ministerial cabinate meetings we share what each Ministry is doing and then we take good practices from each other but as a woman I want to congratulate again our CEO and to thank one connect for what you're doing you're relatively a young entrepreneur but your impact is already felted around the world thank you very much for that and I hope other young entrepreneurs here there's kizito from Cameroon I hope you listen to this he too is you're here oh great that is one of them too who is engaged in it and I suspect that he'll be going back to Cameroon with all all other contacts to expand his work in the it and AI sectors thank you very much thank you so much ma'am I I wanted to just get I know we're running short on time but just I heard saw two other hands up at this table so we'll take those two comments and then we'll close um yeah please go ahead sir mer Minun for [Music] develop Capac for M and I think you're right there is a lot of potential for New Vision new directions uh to move and establishing these public you know harnessing the internet for public uses and public good that's I think uh no continent has really set that model and I think Africa could be a that sets that model sir last comment here and then we're going to break for lunch so please sir go ahead oh thank you so much um I'm Manan katundu secretary for education for Malawi um I would like to really appreciate our presenters connect and Madame coo quite inspiring presentations with regard to Madame se's presentation the issue of balance balancing between entrepreneurship and studying because she was studying that sometimes can be a challenge with our students and also um making sure that there are policies that would allow that to happen while students are in school because you need to have the time both for your um learning and and so on so access to jobs um is important um and so in this in the case of the CEO from connect I I I appreciated your mindset regarding the access to Capital but some Enterprises require intensive capital and they will require some support at the beginning if you're in agriculture you might need to access equipment which you may not have so some sometimes grants and support can have a place uh including uh um uh what they call appren ships um for those who are starting up so that they can build a reputation uh of being able to uh deliver so production also e-learning presents an opportunity in different countries for production of e-leaning equipment laptops tablets and as countries we may need to be looking at what is the opportunity to Pro promote econom iomic activity entrepreneurship while we are supporting eling within the country so that we not always importing everything there are things to import but there are things that we need to start producing in country thank you very much thank you so much sir I think I think those last those comments were very much comments I mean they give us sort of a direction what uh what what perspectives you're seeing from from governments in in the region in the continent so I thank you for those comments and I want to give a final round of Applause to our excellent panel [Applause] here and uh have a great lunch we look forward to seeing you in the afternoon thank you very much [Music]"
 and i would like to become an aeronautical engineer my name is rani hogandora i study in holocaust makuani and then i grew up i learned to become a lawyer sciences have been quite challenging especially math and physics i do all the sciences and i find biology to be so hard learning the traditional way the textbooks and teachers classes has been quite challenging because it changed with the majority sometimes you're left behind and you don't get to understand what you learn my experience at that has so far it's an it is very interesting videos the experiments that i learned there can be able to understand more better my experience from the rasa has been quite good because i'm learning all the sciences from it and it is helping me understand more because if i don't understand i replay the video again i was very happy to be able to join the rasa the rasa is quite healthy and it helps one understand more and learn what you've not covered and your grades will improve i would like all the other students to join the rasa helps one to understand more about the subjects it's interesting you cannot even want to skip even a day without going to the classes you

e-learning and library services are well established here at cavalier university we use various open source and a few proprietary programs to implement these services we employ high power servers to host some of these platforms over the internet through our isp the research and education network for uganda random the core e-learning activity is run on the model e-learning platform which integrates other services like google maps and big blue button for teleconferencing and several other integrations moto is an extremely advanced and secure open source learning platform which allows for lecture student engagements uh both synchronous and asynchronous and it also allows for assessments and grading is accessible via the web through a web browser and also through a mobile app called copy which is available on the google play store module also has a rich api which allows for the development of custom functionality as the ict department we have developed a reporting tool that allows lecturers dean's heads of department and management to gain insights into e-learning activities using live data from murder this generates real-time reports on various activities of student staff engagement and performance for the e-library systems we have the main library catalogue implemented with the core integrated library system this allows students to access the online library catalog and ability to manage their physical lending and borrowing the university pays various publishers for subscriptions to various online resources like journals and databases and when on campus students and staff have authentication to these resources that are paid for  of campus users can access these paid resources via the my loft service where each student and staff is authenticated through their personal university account it's also worth mentioning that the university has a single sign on the core of its hostile services including wi-fi access 
foreign imagine if you couldn't go to school because there weren't any schools available to you the government schools are overcrowded and the teachers are not accountable to be present this is the situation for millions of children around the world imagine if you couldn't go to school because there weren't any schools available to you the government schools are overcrowded and the teachers are not accountable to be present this is the situation for millions of children around the world for example in a remote region of ghana a woman named rina wanted to do something serena started a school in a small one-room building but she's only reaching a fraction of children in the community rina's vision is to reach so many more children but because she lacks the access to resources for expanding and improving her school it seems impossible for rina to see her dreams for these children come true but it is possible and we have the opportunity to walk alongside rena edify helps connect people like you to people like rena and the many others who have started private christian schools like david from rwanda alba from dominican republic sergio from peru jaime from ethiopia and a growing list of over eighteen hundred proprietors that represent over four hundred thousand children here's how you can join us in this mission edify is a christ-centered non-profit organization that believes that educating those in physical poverty provides the best opportunity to change a nation and transform the world we partner with social entrepreneurs like rina in order to expand and improve low-fee private schools that directly meet the needs of the impoverished children are these schools fancy no are they affordable absolutely for as little as two dollars per week in tuition low-income students can receive a quality christ-centered education edify comes alongside these schools in three specific ways number one training for school leaders and teachers to provide a christ-centered education as well as business training to run their schools more effectively two capital in the form of loans to improve and expand schools and three integrating education technology to enhance learning outcomes and employability so why is this model been successful it's based on leverage by partnering with local school owners we're able to grow quickly and effectively and your donation is the gift that keeps on giving we leverage your investment the loans are paid back and then loaned out again most importantly we're able to foster a christian worldview transforming first a child then a village and then a nation would you like to play an essential part in making rina's dream a reality and be the change agent who enables a low-income child to one day run her own small business escape destructive poverty and impact her culture for christ join us in our mission to change the world by giving children the tools and education they need to flourish visit edify.org to learn how you can be involved  okay remember thank you very much for joining us for this particular session  this is the teacher's e-learning training which has been organized and sponsored by edifying uganda and um as we have been watching that video it was about 85 what 85 does and some members were asking what is edify and so that video was just a small introduction on the first day we looked at um what edify is we had orientation uh we had orientation uh what edify is and  what what christian school ownership session is we also looked at the ict teachers association these are the organizations which are supporting this training this training is two weeks one week is done and so we are having a recap today then we shall be having the final week next week by friday we should be through  so so edify is the first organization here which has made this possible and in that video they have a model maybe let me ask some members what they are managing to get from that video what is edifice model what is 85's model uh let me just get a few hands what is eddy5's model um if you're being attentive in that video which i played earlier let us be brief like that remove the next section you can put up your hand and  you give us what do you know about edify what is a device mission what does it if i do those are the questions we have right now within like i just want like one two people yes katharine they provide a christ-centered solution to global education crisis um you have read that here on my screen okay once another person who can tell me what is not reading what do you know about 85 yes charles yes thank you they are out to help those heart rich or those who are vulnerable in terms of loan and also trainings okay thank you very much they support the law in the schools actually from the schools that edify has been targeting have been those which don't pay school fees more than 500 thousand schools which i beat you like in that video that you saw we have uh school directors who have started schools in their communities and they're supporting children and parents and sometimes those schools fail and they are closed especially during this period of kobe uh some of these schools i saw some owners renting off their premises what was the score becomes the hotel because it is not easy to run so edify comes in to support these owners to get loans which are a bit easy to pay back but also technology mister let us hear from teachers and teachers and then we continue the next item  teachers okay thank you thank you hello peter yes good morning rogers morning apart from providing loans i'm saying that edify helps to link various stakeholders in education from different regions without to being in one physical place they link them through technology so yeah we can have like a single school of learners but located in different regions thank you okay thank you he's saying that tries to connect the school directors and actually on school different stakeholders yeah yesterday actually there was some meeting on zoom uh we edify with the difference the school leaders and so these schools these school owners can come together and think of solutions to the challenges they could be having so as when you go to website and say go where is what we do you see here schools need training loans and education technology to improve and expand that is the summarizing what edify does yeah so you can be able to read more about that on the website here and when you go to the website we have um if you go to a website of edify and you go to slash uganda you can be able to know about the what is being done in uganda edward is in many countries uh it is in many countries in  in africa latin america northeast india and there are a number of countries there where edify is so if you click on uganda you'll be able to see what is being done in uganda what is being done in uganda so they need over 400 thousand children uh estimated to be out of school according to statistics from unesco and some of them from upe cannot read and write simple questions in mathematics literacy is 78 percent and uh the population below the waterline is at eight percent so 85 started in 2019 uh that's when they started uh it was not in uganda and they came to uganda and started getting in touch with the school they started getting partner schools on board so they have given out over 390 loans to 376 schools this has been sent out in loans and over 239 schools have been impacted uh so we we're having  some good work here that is being done by edify uganda so you can be able to go to the website of edify and you read more about edifying we are having a team uh the edified team in uganda we have a number of people who are part of the device team maybe they just load and then i'll be closing so you can go this side of edify and you read more about what they do they are uh what they are solving and um they need the problem statement so this is an organization which is international and uh it doesn't have any interest in creating a school of its own because we're here in some parents who is saying to empower the teachers and encourage the teachers to train and be better in what they are doing okay so um i wanted to to load to to show you about the team in uganda here but i think you might just blink go to that page so let me talk about the christian school owners association this christian school owner association is their organization  and  these are private schools and they come together and um they have um uh christian examinations boards uh school exchange programs academic trainings parent seminars leadership and governance they have some training on on managing school because there are some of there are some school owners who have their schools in their in their briefcase if you uh and it's naked p1 pays school fees the teacher just goes to the bus i zip it must give me fifty thousand there and he gets a burden because where there is little management of the school so at the end of the day the school falls down but the christian school another session here he has um some of the team members here they share on how they can manage the schools to make sure that the schools work so if you're a school owner or you are a part of this a christian school and you want to join the association you can come here and you get in touch with you you get the contact for the administrator and you call them and you see how you can get involved in that particular work yeah so that is that then finally we have the ict teacher association of uganda yeah so for uh the city association of uganda which i represent is um having over 2000 members who have joined these are ict teachers mainly we met during workshops which organized by the grand communications commission at colorado s that's where we started that's where it was born government was putting together each other vice city to do returning so this including i don't know if i'm breaking so this tooling uh brought us together as teachers and we have been organizing workshops to improve our methods of work and also to be ambassadors of technology not only foreign teachers but not just about teaching ict but also integrating ict in other subjects in history in sst in english how can i sit here there so that is education technology spearheading what is the role of an eye city teacher in a school and i said she should be able to support the fine arts teacher and i said to this i should be able to support the chemistry teacher regarding ict and also you should be able to support the head teacher a school administration report cards all those things so we also encourage our members to start our projects so that they get additional income instead of crying for that salary only if a teacher knows how to make websites that is something you can do after class it gets four hundred thousand additional one day on the money the school has given if a teacher can set up a a small cafe and he's being run by his brother and for him he comes to service and make sure that the thing is running what can a teacher do so teach entrepreneurship what can a teacher do like during this period of kobe when school is closed i see teachers you have been encouraging them that please don't just hold your hands do something yeah we also support ict clubs so that the learners don't just study ict for the sake of your name but they get lifelong skills and innovate so that is the ict association we have a lot of members and the executive you can read more about the ict teachers and the members and the executive committee we have an executive of 56 members in the whole country in eastern in western in northern so we partnered with the eddy5 eddy5 cam called us because when they came to uganda they had to identify partners edify works with partners this is the edify team edify team in uganda so when they came here mr lugolovico here was in iran that before he came to uganda and um he was in iran and that's where he was leading 85. so when we opened they opened uganda he came home and um yeah so they called us and they said okay eddie please come and we do somewhere here so we have mr golovky we have susan from gisha we have anikimbapazi these are some of the the stuff from 85 they also are the staff in their offices yeah so basically that is it about the introduction now when it comes to this particular training um we have a schedule of topics that we wanted to teach to train on the members and this is the training schedule uh that we have been having i'm going to be requesting the various uh facilitators to give us a recap of some of the sessions uh and highlights of what they have been uh training on then later on we are going to have questions and answers which are going to be answered uh by uh by by all of us yeah so uh we are going to be having uh the facilitators here we have a number of facilitators who who have been supporting this training maybe i can also talk about the facilitators but before i continue let us tell you about the program so we have um the first day on monday we looked at the introduction session which is having the objectives expectations and program overview we also looked at registration and enrollment in the training programs and the main speakers were me and dennis from edify so we looked at what is the importance of this training and uh what do we expect at the end of the day and also we enrolled the members into the whatsapp group the google classroom and we also told them about the youtube channel where the videos are so we looked at that then on day two we looked at zoom how do you use zoom to deliver lessons zoom is a video conferencing app all of us right now are using zoom in this session but how do you apart from using it to attend a session how do you set up your own meetings how do you what are the best settings to do do you set a meeting when it is recurring or you set a meeting at a particular date how do you handle security issues like noise like  other distractions yeah so we also got someone uh from edge line techno uh solutions the providers of zoom in uganda who shared with us how schools can be able to get licenses as absolutely costs so that is the zoom and how you can set it up then we on wednesday we looked at creating instructional presentation materials and looked at presentations and in this case we looked at using presentations on executive using powerpoint and also on mobile using wps office and online using google slides you can use google slides online to create slides which can be saved in your google drive okay so we will say that presentations are the main the most common application we use as teachers to present uh if you are teaching on zoom or even on the projector physically in a class you use powerpoint okay then we looked at the  we looked at the creating video and this was also handled by uh henry was i mean presenter here and we looked at a number of programs uh members dc remember the programs we talked about which can be used for creating videos anyone who can remember what are some of the programs we talked about which you can use to create videos yes peter we use the obs obs obs okay any other any other person software what else hey remember the attended this session yes catherine flashback express 5 yes flashback express thank you very much catherine uh what else do you look at  okay so mr henry is going to be coming show us um how you can use flash a quick it's going to give us a quick overview on that then on friday that was yesterday we looked at the collaboration using google drive and uh we were looking at the email and google drive before you get google drive you must have an email which you are going to access to use google drive and do collaboratively we created documents together collaboratively we created files and we uploaded them into the same drive and that was yesterday okay so um next week next week we are going to be having working with mobile devices we are going to be having working with mobile devices of course we have already talked about mobile devices route we have always made sure that we but we shall look at other vital apps and how do you make your phone some members have phones when they are too slow how do you make your phone to be working well if it's the one you're using for this but also we are going to be looking at issues of whatsapp whatsapp is the common chatting platform um is a common chatting platform and some schools have been forced to create whatsapp groups for learners you get your subgroup for senior one after creating it within a few minutes one child shares some funny funny with you which is not appropriate for their class after you have created their sub group desert of chats but also how do you create there are some groups because uh it's also difficult to add the numbers of panels is there a quick way how people can easily join yourself group like in this case in this training we have our subgroups we created but i never we never added the manual the numbers we just uh created a group we got our subgroup link and we sent a bulk sms to you you people just joined yourself so it was easy but if i were to say we get all your numbers then you type the numbers in a phone book and then you start adding them becomes tricky so we are also handling learners in in in the classes there whatsapp is what we are using to communicate how do you control whatsapp how do you restrict it so that people don't share a sperm and you are in charge of the group okay that is one thing we are going to be looking at in in addition to using mobile devices that is going to be on monday then we are going to look at google classroom already we are using it as students but on this day we are going to learn how to use it as teachers and how to mark how to put assignments how to put quizzes how to mark students work and how to return scripts so we are going to be looking that there then we are going to look at youtube and that is going to be handled by henry uh henry he's going to be telling us about how he manages his youtube channel how do you get youtube channel how do you create uh things like playlists how do you stream to your youtube channel as a school you may need a youtube channel because that's where some of the lessons the learners can go back and rewatch those who missed the sessions so even this session is live on youtube and you will be able to access it uh if you miss it so youtube is very important and it helps videos become easy then we shall have isaac isaac um well he's going to be telling us about colibri which is used to create a digital library which can be accessed offline locally in your computer lab at school you can turn those computers from having microsoft word excel alone or to having reading materials when learners go to the computer lab they don't just play cards but they go there and they read the chemistry they read biology they read the history how do you turn your computer lab into a digital library we are going to be looking at that using colibri on thursday finally we shall discuss as we pass you out challenges and strategies for e-learning what are the best practices how do you get started so that you can be able to run e-learning programs members that is the plan for this particular week for the week which we have had and they they they they want them the plan for the coming days okay um this time let me just before i call the first members there you can be able to just give us quick feedback which of these sessions is really important to you oh what do you what's your comment about this program at this stage yeah i just want like only two members um and then we go to the recaps and by the way when you get a chance you can introduce yourself you tell us where you if you're a teacher

what we learned yesterday how to create an email and then maybe um how to create an email how to create whatsapp groups you know all those ones those ones i've been familiar with and i've been using them the only challenging thing was the the gmail and the google drive and that is a i'm not sure i've not yet got that very well and then also presentation is it some presentation on an instructional materials something like where you can do it on video so maybe that is what needs to be more emphasized yeah but this is a very good program and i've benefited a lot i've actually learned most of the things that i used just to hear from the ict teacher but of course we were not able to access most of these thank you so much okay thank you very much finally eric hello yes hey i was there but i

also have a website we are teachers by the way so if you thought websites are for people who work in in mtn uganda only you're mistaken we are teachers talk about the teachers but we have websites you are a healthy teacher you should have a website where you showcase they call you for seminars you can teach for me is facilitate workshops in different places i i am the national coordinator for the ict chairs association of uganda and i'm a a team lead uh meet athlete uh what in wordpress community uganda what was the software for making websites uh in ginger and also a study in kampala i am the director of the city solutions uganda where we do give support to ict including things of printing and also the co-founder of shareability uganda a bitter uganda is um an educational website you can try to visit a website called shareability.net uh sharepoint.net you will find there materials i don't know if is there anyone here whatever the disability you can put up your hand and let's see abilities a website having materials for all classes from nursery up to tertiary so when you go to shareability they are materials for free you'll see this side necessary baby killers middle duplicators up to senior six and their subjects here so if you want a particular resource you can either click on those or you can come here and select that i want for primary and say i want if you want mathematics you say i want mathematics and then you choose mathematics in the drop down and you submit then you'll get all the materials for primary mathematics which you can be able to share with your teachers the teachers can be able to modify and uh use them especially when you're teaching online uh some of your teachers may they may not have managed to type work uh quickly but they can be able to use this uh these resources here then when they open they can download using this yellow button and as many of these materials are kept in google drive but we are just linked they are just linked here so if you click on it it will open a google drive link and you'll be able to click on this download button here at the top there are materials for all the subjects these materials are we get them from whatsapp exclusively on whatsapp whatsapp teachers here so for us we put them in one place so that we can't be able to use them so you can get notes first papers and all other things so that is radius so at this time i want first invite let us do things backwards i think i'm saying moses is going to be getting one uh later we shall maybe conquered with zoom uh henry henry henry the computer guy you can come in and maybe first take us you come and give us a recap on presentations at this time and then with you okay okay so can i share my screen yes are we all seeing yes we can see first stop sharing and remove that optimize for video cliche and you don't put that optimize for video so that it appears clear  is it clear is coming have you started sharing when you are sharing the zoom window there is an option for okay i think it is better fine okay you can proceed okay so i'm going to begin with uh specifically the presentation and for us to access our presentation we said we come to our start and we look through our programs then we shall look for uh the software we are going to be using which is specifically power powerpoint so you give it some time to load and by default it will give you that don't show this okay and we are actually going to be using uh a blank presentation let's say we are creating something from scratch okay so we want uh to come up with a presentation this is what we are having on our slides like it's going to be acting as our page and on it we have some boxes called the placeholders whenever i want to write on a page or a slide you will click onto those items that tell you that click to add item or title or subtitle and uh total if you want to write something there you can click anywhere that you feel you want to type for example if i want to type something about an accident i can just come and say accident simple as that then i can come to that subtitle i can let's give a definition that simple one can say let's say sudden so then happening that can can lead to loss of lives so we are going to use three slides just specifically so that is the first slide we have and uh i think it's okay so if i told you you want to move these uh placeholders you can drag them onto those parameters you move these items any location you feel you want so you can as well come back and put another slide but remember we have a lot of slides here you can pick from the ones you want it can be a title it can be tightened content it depends on exactly what you want to write about under the slide that you want to use so you can come on the second i can't say we can be having this recourses so we can as well decide to put this one in the middle then we can talk about a little three or four let's say over speeding enter to go down to the next line we can say overloading then we can say let's say slip array roots you can have the last slide that the one we are going to be working on so we can say this is some of the solutions we can let's see how to prevent so you can't put that one in the middle again let's say we have some little points here let's say uh installing traffic lights let's say putting up some laws on overspeeding and say let's say arresting some okay arresting let's say putting up road signs just like that so that is actually what we are going to be using in this session we can make some changes here for example i have this title i can as well come and highlight then make some changes for example i want to make it uh bold i can increase the let's change the style that i want to use you don't think it can change accordingly you can as well change the size for it to become more bigger just like that then we can add a color i say this i want to use a red color just like that so if i come here i can as well do some of the items if i say if i had made a mistake i can come and pick from the what's available i picked the rate the rate one i can't hold i can put a color different one can come to this i can also leave it as that i can come and choose this can choose another color also then having done that we can come to some of our installing in putting some of the images if you at all we wanted you can come to insert so when you click on insert it will give you where you can insert for example you wanted to put some pictures for some shapes there it can as well give you that option so we can insert a picture but uh first of all you can not be happy at all you're not having some of the pictures on your computer you can download them from the internet for example i can come to my my google chrome i can type something that i want to search about for example if i have it here i can say put accidents there i press enter when i come to accidents i come to some of the images here so they'll give me some images related to accident there are many here as we have seen i can pick the one i feel i want for example i want this i can right click on it i say save the image and i'm going to save the image on my computer so i can say click let me save it in my documents and i can give it let's say scc1 so it will tell me that it is downloading you're seeing it it's downloading it and it is finally downloaded so i can go where the picture is by coming to this option then i can go to show in folder and it i
 here i can right click on it i copy you can right click on it and copy it to your your work then come back to your presentation which is already here you can paste it anywhere you feel you want by coming on home you can zip it and the image comes to your your work i can put it up here and move this one a little down just like that and get another one and we call it we leave that one for example if i get this whatever we come to where it is we train folder we copy it come back we can paste it on slide two then we can make it bigger by analyzing the parameters so that is that that is it for the images so now we can come to the design after inserting some of the images we can come to the design we pick a design for our presentation for example i can use this i can use you go on looking through so it gives a look to your presentation for example you can make some modifications as exchanges that look for your presentation so it will depend so that those are some of the designs you can even come and change some of the colors depending on what you have actually chosen from that from the themes there it goes on changing the theme of your presentation and having done that we can as well come and use some of the transitions what is a transition a transition is specifically that effect that occurs as a slide is changing to another so we have one side we have another one we have another one so as one is changing to two what is it going to do it can let's say for example if it's the first one we can let's say use a carton for it to open we are beginning our presentation so it will open for us that is specifically the transition i come to slide 2. you can even give it a duration it can take by having it here i come to this i can also choose another one let's say i want uh to use this one so it can be in that format i come to another slide if actually you want to use the same transition you say apply to all so it will help you to apply everything to that one so i can put this let's say i want to use that one and that is specifically the transition you can even give it that delay or raise you you change on that delay and you put some time there so we come to the animation so for the animation you click on a certain message slide you click on what you want to give an animation what is an animation first of all it is specifically that effect that you give to any object or image it can be the image or the text it is the life you give to it now this one doesn't move but i can give life to it and it starts moving for example i can't say it can float in after floating in i can emphasize it for example i click on it again i say spin around it can't change like that there's a way that thing attracts the attention of alana and they remember on the qualities of a good presentation aren't supposed to include in many animations because they will attract the attention of the what of the learner so they will not be paying attention you put i mean many more and even the images you're putting into your presentation have to match your topic let's say i also want to put it onto this one i can't say that one simple as that you come to this you select where you want to put you come and choose from any let's say you want to give this car let's say it is a it is a car you want to give it motion then you will come to the motion so we have here i can come to this i pick any animation that i feel i want then i click here on the points i'll also give them the one i feel i want just like that come to them and give them any that you feel you want so that is actually on uh animation and uh if you give the animation you can also click and see how on the task on animation pen you can as well uh see them from here as you play play them for example you cannot play and see how it will be working you can even add some other options on these arrows for example if i'm on here i can come and add some some timing or other effects options if you feel you wanted to add others so now we come to the slide show you done your with your presentation you want our audience to look at it let's say you have a project i want to project it you'll come to the slideshow and come either from the beginning or from the current site such as covers the entire screen for the audience to see and when you click on it it will come and cover the entire screen for your audience to see so you'll begin making your presentation and if you had actually put animations there you will actually be seeing how they uh move on your on your what on your screen those are the transitions of the animation you make a video out of that presentation it is not enabled okay you you can remove that that you can either demonstrate using that or you can use flashback whatever but you show us also how to make a video out of your presentation okay so i i use flashback what use any which you want you can use flashback or you can use it as if there's an option there for recording but it depends on the version of things under slideshow let me see and there's a record slide show there is some record slideshow so start recording from the beginning then we start recording from that current slide let's say from the beginning we want to be part of the beginning then after that you export yeah okay so let me click let me first close this one come back to the slide show then we recall recorder from the beginning so it will ask you select what you want to record before you begin that means that i'll select order that's slides and the animation timings then then everything that is on that on that on the slide sounds it start recording so then you make your presentation let's see what is an accident it's specifically a sudden happening that can lead to loss of life let's say like that continue clicking on how you're going to be presenting your what use your presentation to the audience you keep on going through your presentation just uh the way you have how you want to do everything that it is there then uh assuming that these are the points that we are actually having so it will actually help us to do that so having finished your presentation is a timing sorry okay now you go to export firespot file go fileman fileman export export what can we export a video create a video then uh it is uh it has been uh on our favorite okay under my my videos do i have them i don't open videos here can i click okay so we look for for it and we see it takes some few minutes i think to export is this showing you that he's exporting yeah let me let me kick oh he's showing that he doesn't immediately it is here try to play it and receive it's still exporting actually that's close yeah so as it is exporting we can go and look at flashback a little hey so members creating a video you can create a video directly from powerpoint there without needing any other software uh but um yeah slideshow you record after recording you export it makes your video and in that case it even uh it makes a video out of your what out of you and it even picks your sound because we said slides alone elena may not be easy to read and understand but if you add an explanation using the uh record when you record slides into a video video you can put on youtube channel and learners can watch and hear explanation and they understand than just slides so one of the tools is already within that is the this far point but uh you may want to use something more better that that like flashback where you can even add your webcam image where there are more options like the yeah like the the mouse and all those other options yeah so um so that is the that one is it's not showing you the progress where it is exporting from you can minimize that it is not showing me the progress but let me check again if you find you just minimize it you got flashback now okay you can mean now so now we look uh for your flashback for example i have it in the corner here you double click on it it will open where do we get flashback from okay so now before we open it we have to download it over the internet let me close it yes you don't close you can just tell us that you got the website and download you may not download it again for example if i open a new tab here i'll come to my google type there flashback explains and i think it is already there if i click on it so i and select the flashback express the best free screen recorder i click on that link so when i click on it they're taking us to their website or to that website that has it and when it comes you're going to come to the section of downloads but remember it has two options it has the flashback flow that records and even makes some editing but you have to pay for it this one is the one that we need flashback express that is only for recall recording so i can click on it and it will be downloading just like that you click on an arrow so it will help you to download that item it is now going to download it from it just for seconds it is not without having a bigger size so having downloaded it you go to your download section on the computer and installed it let me see you come to start you can listen to your computer opc you come to the download section you click there so these are some of the files i've downloaded that are related to that so this is one two three so whenever you download it it will be putting it onto your computer because i've downloaded it multiple times so after you double click on it and it will install so i've already installed it i'm not going to install again so i'm going i'm closing this we are going to see when you install it it will give you two items the flashback express recorder and even the player such that after you recording you can even play what you have what you have recorded so you double click on it and when you double click on it it will open the flashback express 5 like that so the first screen is uh for you to select what you can record for example what do you want to record i want to record my screen it can be a full screen some region or window and for my case i want the full screen then you have to check the option for the microphone if you don't check it it will not get the sound that you're going to be recording so you have to check that option these are some of the basic this basic item and uh on to the webcam here you want the camera someone to be seeing you as you're presenting you can also include a camera there just like that then after you're recording something it has to go in the recordings that's why you're seeing some of the items i've recorded they are here and which i will see how we can actually work with it so another one option let's say you need to put some shortcuts there you can come to the settings you say for example when i start recording it will be minimizing my flashback for example using a toolbar it puts it down here and starts timing you but that one is not all that fine you always have to hide it so i put it under the icon trick so that it comes down here when i where people don't see it when i'm when i'm actually presenting my video so it will come down there but if you put it on a tray on a floating bar it will be indicated here as it is timing and therefore you wanted to make some editings in that video the timing will be different someone will be seeing that someone is making some timing here and uh this is two this is seven this is again back to two so it will be confusing so for that video we have set the camera the other side these are very fine if you set them the other side they can be okay so you can put some of uh let's say the hot keys to start recording such that you don't always have to click on it here you can use that f2 let's say stop recording f3 let's say you want to pause f5 it depends on what you want after that you can say okay those are some of the basics you can put you don't need a lot you can say okay so that means that i'm going to minimize it so i'll use my shortcuts remember i've put f2 so when i minimize it it will go away then i press my function f2 onto my keyboard because i've already put the shortcuts up but if you don't use that one you can come back down here and look for read and click on that start you see we can start it from here or if you don't use this you can use that shortcut let's say if what f2 for recording and you tell us that it is starting to record and if you want to stop you can press function function three so it will start recording everything that i'm now saying for example i had a presentation i can come back to my presentation i click on it i can go back to the slideshow from the beginning then i'll say let's say today we are going to be introducing uh let's say road accidents and what is an accident it's specifically certain happening that can lead to loss of life uh as that your for everything that you're going to be talking about is what you click on actually just because that i'm faster i don't want to make the videos too long you click you continue explain everything that you wanted to talk about those points will be coming let's go to the last slide just like that so after you finishing with your presentation you can press escape then it goes or just takes you back so that means that i'm done with my presentation i can't stop my what my flashback express and we use the shortcut which was f3 so i'm going to press function f3 on my key my keyboard for it to stop and it is now stopping so having recorded it will ask you you have a recording do you want to play it do you want to save it or you want to delete it for my case i don't do anything here i don't play i just set it just because i can click by mistake and it goes away when i'm done recording it so i click on save and i can do anything that i want later so i can save it let's say pre presentation and you give it a location actually where you want it to be to be saved let me call it presentation too because i already have presentation so you pick for the location where we want it to go let me say documents and when i come to my documents i can say flashback movies then i can say presentation i click ok so it is going to be saved there now we want to see our recording where do we find it we come back to the option of the recording and it takes us a presentation too but remember it is in a file extension called fbr some software's don't want this option or format it is not always accessible for example you wanted to make some editing it will not allow you to make some editing when it is having this format so you have to convert it in another format for example mp4 api and others so you will come to avi or you can even save it online if you have your google drive you can save it online let's say you created account there so now i come to export first that i can convert it to another format i want then i'll say i want it to mp4 then you come and say okay so it will tell it i'm going to export your you okay we say export where do you want to save it let me save it in the same location where i saved the other one flashback such that it can be here i can call it presentation to export it such that the names do not appear to be the same okay so it will start exporting you give it some time and it will depend on the size of uh the video that you have made don't make too too large large videos actually the size will be always larger and they will always actually take much of your space let's say if you're sharing that data over the internet it will be harder so now it has finally finished our our expo conversion we come and open where it is it is finally here we can play it and see double click on it see for example i had a presentation i can come back to my presentation i click on it i can go back to the slideshow from the beginning so then i'll say let's say today we are going to be introducing uh let's say road accident we have seen that it is another thing i wanted to tell you is that when the video actually has a larger size you don't have to worry about it there's a certain software we can use to uh to reduce the what the size of the of a video for example it is a handy break you can go to your google and search for let's say we have another tab here i'm going to type there and break and break download i can click enter so they'll give me download the handy brake i click on it so that software is going to help you to reduce the size of your videos if a video has been having let's say over 200 mbs it can be reduced to a actually up to somehow let's say 40 50 it will depend and for my case i've already downloaded it i'm not going to download again let me show you how it works a little so it is already installed on my computer because my videos over youtube i always have to compress them like that they can be over smaller size at times but when you over compress a video it will lose some of the quality so you don't have to over compress it to a smaller size you get so i'll open my handy brake just like that you give it some time to open so that is it and it will come just like that you get then we look for powerful that has our our video that we have recorded remember it was presentation do exported so i will hold it i drag i drop to my handy break and when you drag and drop it there it is going to come here and you have to choose some of the formats you want and for my case i always put them over internet youtube i always use the web option i can use it when it is five email 10 let's say 10 minutes five minutes or three minutes so you can choose on the size that you want to use let me use that this one after resize three minutes video i give the location where i want it to go then i say i want it let's say in any location that you feel you want that means that the size is going to be somehow smaller than the one we had so i can give it the same okay let me copy this name copy ctrl c i give it here let's say i put it the best control v let me i call it exported two or three such that we shall compare the two and the three the sizes i say okay then i'll come and say start encoding it will start down showing you the progress that it is encoding or compressing your your video so you give it something and it also it will depend on the size if the size is too large then it will take long to compress if the size is small then it will take some bit of smaller time to to compress so that means that it's going to be reducing the size of your video after we come and look for it remember it has we have put it in the same folder where we we had our other files so it is here this is a three and it is finally here so we want to compare the sizes this is the one we have we had in the beginning this is the one we had at last so i can right click on it and see the properties so you give it some time so it has a properties and it's telling us that it is having four point six c to n bits let's come on to this one theory and we see the properties also right click on it and come to the properties and it is now showing us that the difference you see the difference this one is having four point six two this is having three just because you're not seeing a bigger change it is because the the size was close to each other but if you had a larger video then you would see a bigger change in that sizes when you look at the sizes yeah and that's right yeah so enrichment yes please yes uh okay thank you members um what henry has been showing there is the uh i recap on presentations and video uh creating a presentation and turning it into a video either recording within powerpoint or using flashback they are individual tutorials for each of those and also reducing the video size because sometimes you record the video and it will be 1gb so you can reduce that 1gb into 200 mb which you can easily upload to save your letter but if you are sending it like runners on whatsapp or whatever it is better to reduce the size using flashback we have a tutorial on each of those stages and uh that's one of the things we have been discussing during the week uh also the same can be done using a phone you can use wps office or any other slides app on the phone to create slides and also you can be able to use a screen recorder you can use a screen recorder on your phone to make uh to still make the to still make the the what day the video so actually henry has also made a tutorial for that for the phone so we should be uh comfortable to do whatever we want uh so members have been asking you that you posted any questions there in the church uh we are going to be responding so here i'm just hearing this is my phone for me i was using the this recorder called the mobizen but uh henry told us that there is a better app for me i use this one for the mobizen this one here this red one here which has uh this one is that i i use on my computer here yeah but uh mobizen but uh you can go and uh install run that henry show with us you go to your play store and then you code it's called watch me video um yeah seeing very many here i don't know which one is the correct one yeah when you're and use the one when you're getting another one yeah they are on top there are many there it is number three number three screen recorder video it is having 10 million uh 10 million downloads plus and it has 4.7 in ratings this one here screen record the video record david record light yeah okay so members uh this one is recommended by henry uh you can be able to install it and then you use it to do screen recording on phone and also uh you can yeah so that you can be able to add explanation to your notes and uh create educational instructional content which learners can use to study and yeah so that is the one thing so this is the videomap recorder light and it is telling me i love floating button uh okay let me say allow uh allow display over other apps i allow um benny allow i have to allow all these permissions so that it can be able to work so it will bring some categories there is a floating toolbar they say i've got it and what is so if i want to record i will go to my slides so for me i use the i use my slides i use an app called slides for the slides so it is also an app you can download this one on google slides but you could use the wps office and whatever okay so this is the thing so if i want to present this presentation of yesterday which yeah we had we had with the oh if i want to teach let me go if i want to teach computer system these are slides on my phone which i have opened so i'm teaching i've been this i'm not saying maybe another ginger college okay so maybe i'm now in another school so i can say okay i'm not in in ginger college so i can edit so on phone you can edit your slides so on phone you can edit your slides uh you see so maybe i'm working at uh if the tower was a school let me put it out so you see i've done that just to show you how you can edit your phone this is a slide power point and i'm editing i can create a new slide i can do whatever i want so after i finished i can go to slideshow mode i can rotate my phone i enable the rotation then i can have my phone rotated okay and then after that i can go to slideshow mode so it is going to go slightly short mode there now my video recorder is somewhere here there is a floating button so i can say okay vedima please start recording allow you say allow then i search start then it will start recording i start okay [Music] hello children this is your teacher from utah i'm going to be teaching computer system so i got the next slide the following objectives for our lesson we are going to describe the computer system so i'm making a video using my phone yeah so um and i think he there's a conflict whether when you when you're doing recording and you're also on zoom uh you may not be seeing what i'm doing now because of that surface let me let me stop the recording yeah so basically um you should do be able to use your phone let me let me stop this recording here because of that okay so i was trying to demonstrate there um if you when you do it without zoom it will be able to do it well yeah because the zoom is using the microphone and also the recording but video i think is a great app for recording okay so after we have recorded our work and we have done our presentations and our videos and our schemes of work and other things they are on my phone what if it was a thief steals the work but if i see steals my phone then i started hey i made the lesson yesterday i prepared my resume and i was supposed to teach you p5 this is on the phone it has been stolen you never backed it up on the crowd mr murut is coming in to show us how we can be backing up our work on the cloud so that we always have the work safe and we can even collaborate with other people on the same document it's like that is always available mr morod come and tell us more about collaboration okay please uh good morning everyone i hope i'm being heard properly yeah so yesterday we talked about gmail and then google collaboration like working together with colleagues on the same document on the same presentation which is one of the privileges that we get when we have our google drive accounts active but then in summary i want to just talk about gmail then we shall maybe uh try to do something yeah we shall do a simple demo very fast so when when we talk about gmail gmail is one of the three emailing platforms provided by google and these days to hope to anybody who embraces technology and since we are on a campaign to bring on board all of you who are going to be teachers who are shifting from being traditional teachers to be digital teachers so you realize that you cannot be a digital teacher when you do not have a gmail account because having a gmail account provides you with a lot of privileges and a lot of services of course when you have a gmail account you get to access very many google based services like google classroom i'm happy that most of you i believe are already interacting with google classroom so next week we shall be learning more about google classroom as mr rogers told you so having a gmail account also gives you a chance to be able to to create and own a youtube channel just like the way you were seeing mr rogers was showing you henry the computer guy mr wall and the rest of the members so what those people had in order for them to create that youtube channel that you saw each of them having was basically having a gmail account and then there are other other other google services like google contacts where you can save thousands and thousands of contacts just in case uh your sim card gets lost you have at least where you can go and access all your content and then the popular google play store where most of us who have uh the android devices where we download all the apps like whatsapp we download it we download whatsapp from the google play store and then the rest of those apps are like the google drive that we are talking about uh and then uh we have a google meet which is also another video conferencing tool and then you can see all those services that all those apps that you are seeing there they are all available for you to use but the number one prerequisite for you to be able to access them is having a gmail account so we shall later on talk about online collaboration where you can work on documents online you can work on documents in the cloud and you can work with more than one with more than two people on the same document from you at different locations like right now we are having school lockdowns and you might find that some people travel to their villages but then because we have the locker down that doesn't mean that everything should come at a hold you can create a document you can create maybe a google document and then you can be in position to harmonize as a department and then you can be able to prepare your lesson notes you can be able to prepare google satellites which you can build a position to use when schools resume so maybe quickly i wanted us to look at a simple demo on how you can create how how you can create how you can sign into your gmail account i believe all of us have gmail accounts if you do not have one please i'll request you to go to google classroom we have uploaded enough resources which guide you on how to come up with one so uh to of course for you to be able to access a gmail account if you are using a a laptop or a computer you will need to use an internet browser you will need to use an internet browser which is a software which allows you to browse the internet when you are using the computer so meanwhile if you are using a mobile device uh you will have to download uh a gmail app from the google place play store it is where you find all the different apps that can be installed on the phones so for this particular case let's try a demo with a computer so i'll open it an internet browser which is called google chrome but you might be having a firefox you might be having microsoft edge our pair meaning and the rest so for this particular case let's open uh google chrome so once i open google chrome i should be in a position to type here gmail gmail.com so once i type gmail.com it will ask me to choose an account so why is it asking me to choose an account it is because there are quite many accounts which have been which have ever been signed into using this internet browser so for this particular case i'm going to select mine which is george and then it will ask me to enter a password so i type my password there then i come and click next so it is now loading and it is taking us to my gmail account so once uh it opens like that the very first interface you are welcome to is that inbox your inbox the inbox is where all the emails all the messages that have been sent to you it's where they get to so when you look at it here i have very many messages actually i have a total of 1856 the ones which you are seeing which are appearing autopia are they recent ones and you can see the time they they arrived into my inbox the time is available so to be sure that i've signed into my account i see that my profile picture here and then [Music] when i'm here i can be in position to uh to read the different images that that that that have been sent to me like you can see here like like there is this one which came from mr yes and so i can click on it and then it should be in position to open so so you can see the details of the email are sent by mr rogers here so if i want if i want to respond to this email just click on reply and then it opens an interface or a place where i can type the message i can type something and then i i will say ok sir will surely do it okay and then i click send and then i am notified that i'm notified that the message has been sent so mr regas has already received this so if i want to say the sent messages the messages that i have ever sent to someone or to add to certain people i can come to the send the send section of my emails and you can see these are the different images that have been sending to people and then the products is where i can i can i can store some emails that i'm not ready to send at that particular time i can prepare anime and then i save it as a job such that i can be in a position to send her to send it at a later time i've actually replied your email come again okay proceed i was just saying that i've replied your email here just sent okay so let me go to the inbox and see the reply that uh you can see mr radius has just replied and then i can see the details here is saying thank you for the reflect so this is a very good platform whereby we as teachers we can communicate with with our learners we can communicate with our colleagues with our friends and also we can communicate it with our our school administrators so these days uh things are changing most corporate companies these days when it comes to applying for jobs most of the companies are chasing away physical application people most of the companies are now shifting to online applications so and the only platform or the only easiest way for you to apply the job online is by using an email so you realize that you it is a must it is something that you cannot live without nowadays where we are headed to so basically that is it in summary yes you go to drive go to drive yeah so as i as i said earlier on once you have a gmail account you you qualify to get the other google-based services like google classroom youtube google drive contacts and play store so let us look at another service called google drive and the google drive is a free it is also a free service from google that allows you to store your files online and then you can be able to access them anywhe
e you go so let us assume are your stored your files maybe your pictures your story your documents as i will be showing you like let me go to my drive very fast so just enter drive.google.com it will take you to your google account automatically the moment at the moment you you open it on a on a browser that already has your gmail account already logged in like you see i love going to this gmail account of mine the moment i i created a new tab and i entered there drive.google.com it automatically takes me to my google drive so i say that with google drive it is a free service which is like an online store where you can store files and once you've stored those files you can do any position to access them anywhere you are and using any in a gadget so any gadget means uh you you might be having um a smartphone a tablet or even a computer so so long as you know the logging details of your google account then then you have direct access to your files your store and online so for example when you look at my google drive i have here different files so up here it shows me the files i i have recently interacted with like you can say i have this one you edited it yes i edited it yesterday and then i edited this in the past month and the rest so i have other files here i even have some videos here okay i have pictures here but with the google drive you can also be in position to organize your your files and folders such that you have a smarter way of arranging your work when you are on your cloud storage so like you can see i have different folders here i have a folder for after ears i have a folder for sharp tech let me tell you my company so i have here ipod having the website information i have a folder having training materials uh and in each of these folders i have a lot of training materials that are used for training learners uh different ict courses so if i am supposed to train elena from anywhere even if i have not moved with my laptop the moment i get access to a smartphone or a tablet or a computer somewhere i can just sign in and then i can be in position to access all this you can see all this this this this is training material i have a lot of it so i i suffocated myself from the burden of carrying a lot of physical documents like handouts notes and so on what i only need to make sure i remember is the password the username and the password in my google account so i can stop you realize i can store my files and i can also access them anywhere whatever i want so to create a folder where you can store your files you can come to this new new button then you can create a folder for this case i'm going to call it uh tutorials okay so and then i click create the moment i create it you can see it is appearing here i can open that folder and then i upload different file formats which can be presentations which can be documents which can be pdf documents we can even videos with an audio so let me upload uh some files inside it so i will still come to new and then i come to file upload then it will take me to my computer where i am going to look for some files under graphic design i have some training materials that are i have been using for training some students graphic design posts so i can select one or multiple of them and then i say open and then you can see down here it is uploading all of them one two lesson one lesson two lesson three they are all here so yeah it is done with uploading and once it is done with uploading maybe maybe i'm working with different some other colleagues and i also want them to access this very tutorials or this very training material so what i only need to do is to share this folder with them the moment i share it with them then it means they can be in a position to access all this material when it is just stored on my google drive so to be able to share with them i'm going to i'm going to right click this uh i'm going to right click this folder i'll right click it and then i will say share when i click share i can be in position to add people i can even add a group of people with google there is a way you can create a contact group of people so you can be in position just to add a group of people so for this case let me share with you more which this is my other email and then um i must give george a marut a certain a certain privilege what should he be imposing to do with the content i'm sharing with him he can be in position to just review he can be in position to to to comment or he can be in position to edit so if i set him to be an editor an editor it means it can be in position to organize he can be in person to add something or to edit the files we can inside that that particular folder so for this yeah yes please you end up our timers is catching us okay then i can notify him and they say please utilize these for training the learners maybe that is what i want him i want to tell him about then i say same and as you see this folder is now changing originally it had it was just a plain it had a plain black icon but now it has an icon of a human being on it that means this is a shared folder and then if someone has shared with me some other folders and files then i can just come and click on shared with me then i can give me position to access all the folders and the files which were already shared with me the other thing that you are capable of doing with google drive is you can collaborate you can work together so you can use uh online or cloud-based applications so when i click on the plus icon i see a variety of the cloud-based uh applications like google docs which can help me to come up with word-based documents this one works like microsoft office word that we install on our local computers and then i can be in position to you can be in question to work on a google sheet with colleagues you can also prepare google google slides these are online or cloud-based uh slides that you can work with colleagues you can you can you can you can create slides you can add a lot of the content and then you can bring version to edit it with different colleagues and then you can collect information from maybe your students with the help of a google phone so all what we are doing here we with convince person to do on a mobile phone for you to be able to do it on a mobile phone you simply need to have the google drive app installed on your phone together with the gmail app so you sign into your gmail app and then you should be in a position to you should be in position to to to send emails uh you should be in a position to read your emails and then you should also be in position to upload files create folders onto your google drive so right yes okay thank you very much mr marut for that recap members um the other application that we looked at was um zoom and this was the first one which we looked at on tuesday on monday we look we had the orientation and that is the other first bit where i was

and prayer is directors of ceremony executive director from the ministry of education arts and culture was it eterbone mr ellis board of representing the board of namco director of namco mrangi management and stuff good morning good morning i have two two short scriptures that i want to share with us today um the book of proverbs 4 7 a very well known scripture says getting wisdom is the most important thing you can do whatever else you get get inside get understanding that's according to the book of uh the good news biblication and then again in the book of daniel 12 verse 4 the last part of it is as follows many will go there and here to increase knowledge so today we are here to for the launch of this e-learning program and i thought that those scriptures are suitable for this occasion and they are self-explanatory people who go around looking for knowledge but there is a promise from god that knowledge will increase in the last days and also we are urged to get wisdom so with those few words on the scriptures i just want us to bow our heads as we are going to pray dear lord thank you for grace and mercy thank you for the wisdom to start a new method of learning it is indicative of increase in knowledge as per your word that says that knowledge shall increase we realize that without your blessings we would not be able to succeed with the plans that we have for the program therefore we invite you as we launch this e-learning program thank you for the gift of creativity and uniqueness and the energy to put them to good use give the students the desire to find ways to excel in their work through this method of e-learning and teach them to work on the path of righteousness that leads to success bless this occasion and all that we do here today as well as always may the work we do bring may may this work bring glory to your name as we serve and empower our nation through education i pray all this in jesus name amen thank you very much mrs kamathi

board mr justin ellis my director mr i doctor harold murangi our executive director for the ministry of education arts and culture and the deputy executive director also in the ministry of education arts and culture ms ida bond you are most welcome i would also like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the presence of our members of the media as well as the organizing committee that made sure that this event is taking place now without further ado i would like to call on the director of namco dr harold vekama murangi to come and do the welcoming dr miranda uh good morning everybody  madam indy representing our minister of education arts and culture madame edda our deputy executive director mr ellis chairperson of the namco governing board my colleagues colleagues from the media we we are here to to witness the launch of our e-learning resources that we have developed in conjunction with the ministry of education arts and culture there are people who are supposed to be here today but because of the challenging times we are facing mr niskay is in isolation meemslo who was also working on the project with us since the beginning she lost the brother last week but i am glad that we are here with dr karipi who is the coordinator for the project she is the right person whenever there are questions from the media to respond to the questions i think is an historical historic event for us in the education sector the launch of our e-learning resources for secondary education it is indeed our honor and privilege to host this event on behalf of our ministry the ministry of education arts and culture i know during these challenging times of government 19 as senior officials of the ministry of education arts and culture madame ed wwed you have other placing matters and commitments of ensuring teaching and landing is taking place and at the same time making sure that we maintain the health and safety of our lenders at schools therefore your presence this morning shows you it shows interest and commitment in making a difference in the lives of fellow namibians in a particular the young ones director of proceedings we are living in the age of ease their e-governance email er let's learning to mention the few those are new innovations that are moving the world forward and not a single institutions want to be left behind you either join or you left behind namco is an institution being one of the key players in the country education system has taken cognizance of these new developments and we have embraced them we are glad to inform the nation that we have introduced e-learning in 2002 with the development of our first radio lessons and in 20 2009 the first video lessons were broadcast on the nbc television with the financial support from the ministry of education arts and culture and the commonwealth of learning namco has developed capacity over the years in the field of e-learning in 2013 we have launched the notes master platform the notes master platform is an open source platform managed by a team of e-learning experts based in the united kingdom and is used for the development and presentation of online content the platform has been promoted by the commonwealth of learning to be used in open schools in many commonwealth countries in africa nose master is used in namibia botswana seychelles tanzania zambia kenya and lesotho since its launch in 2013 the notemaster namibia initiative has trained hundreds of teachers tutors and learners on how to use the platform and how to successfully navigate the internet for engaging learning resources based on the num called e-learning and oer policy all learning resources by developer namco are released under open license with very limited copyright restrictions this means e-learning resources including the ones we are launching today are falling in a category of open educational resources last year in 2020 during the first lockdown the ministry of education arts and culture approved approach namco for partnership in the development of e-learning resources that could be used for teaching and learning especially during difficult times such as this namco has taken this opportunity with appreciation and dedication madam edie the value of partnerships in times like this cannot be overstressed the partnership with our ministry has impacted positively on our institution in terms of building the capacity of staff as well or as gaining recognition although namco has developed e-resources in the past this project has topped the list in terms of the number of resources produced which within the shortest possible time needless to say partnership e-learning in e-learning is the way to go director of proceedings the development of e-learning content is more it's much more a complex exercise if compared to print based content there is always need to spend more time in comparison parties capacitating the content developers with the required technical skills before development starts as well as that continuous support has the development took longer than anticipated we at namco also believe in quality assurance a lot of time has been sent spent in the quality assurance processes making sure that the lessons meet our standards all notes and lessons are peer-reviewed by three developers before the content is posted for use by learners and teachers although the scope of this project goes beyond what namco offers it is a very good experience for my team to work with all subjects from grades 8 to 11 and teachers from all 14 regions subject matter experts found opportunities to collaborate share and exchange their knowledge through online content development process and despite the challenges the teachers are facing in the regions what has stood out during this project is the willingness and the passion that teachers have for learning that was an indication to us that e-learning is indeed the future for our country madame edie let me use this opportunity to thank you and your team for the support you have rendered to namco over the years with the funds that you have advanced to namco in march 2021 we will now commence with the development of content for a s level while at the same time we ensure that all outstanding content for grades 8 to 11 is completed we have engaged the director general of the nbc and a memorandum of understanding is being finalized to broadcast the lessons on radio and televisions colleagues all of us it's our responsibility to ensure that the resources we have launched today are put to good use and this will only happen if we put our hands together as the ministry and i'm called to inform and direct the users on how to access the content if we don't put resources together if we don't put effort together in terms of informing the learners and the tutors it will be a futile exercise so these are a few welcoming remarks feel welcome everybody present thank you and let's stay safe thank you so much  being safe being the word that we need to follow thank you dr murangi for your welcoming remarks it is now my singular honor to call on our executive director in the ministry of uh education arts and culture ms sanetciencamp to come and give the keynote address at this event thank you very much director of ceremonies um ladies and gentlemen and we wish to acknowledge the chairperson of the namco board of governors mr justin ellis also dr harald murangi the director of namco thank you very much for hosting us here today in addition ms era born the deputy executive director for formal education all regional directors and everybody that may be linked up school principals and learners distinguished invited guests and of course our esteemed members of the media the whole namco family ladies and gentlemen i think there's no other place that i would rather want to be today than here and from the onset i wish to register the apologies of our honourable minister honourable esther anani pondoka who's currently in the regions busy with es visits as well as our honorable deputy minister khalid they really really wanted to be here and wanted to be a part of this historic event as dr murangi said we've been looking forward to this event for such a while and on all the platforms that i was given i was talking about the launch of the e-learning uh materials and programs so we are very very delighted as the ministry of education arts and culture to be joining the namco family today in launching the e-learning resources developed through the joint initiative as dr murangi explained by the ministry of education arts and culture and of course namco not only does namibia as a country recognize and strive to achieve the sustainable development goals but especially in this era of uncertainty that we know have caused the biggest education disruption due to the covert 19 pandemic but we also decided as a country that the use of information and communication technology indeed contributes to us achieving the sustainable development goals and by so doing improving the delivery and the management of education we know that new challenges were brought along namibia is one of the 21 countries in eastern and southern africa and out of this 21 countries 20 countries had to close the door for children for schools whether it was temporary whether it last four months but the fact of the matter is that many children could not go to school and their lives for the generations to come were affected we know that culvert 19 has disrupted the education trajectory of eastern and southern africa including namibia and we also know nobody can shy away from the fact that it will leave an indelible mark for generations to come the most vulnerable and the most affected communities are those in rural areas that are affected and in southern eastern and southern africa it's estimated that seven million from primary and secondary children will not be able to return to school full time again we know that ladies and gentlemen as the situation persisted in them in on a global level governments were directed to find alternative ways to ensure that learning continues without requiring teachers and learners to be in the same space at the same time distance education became an absolute alternative mode of learning to all learners and in the context of namibia we are very blessed to have the namibian college of open learning that inevitably becomes a focal point in terms of making distance learning an option for all we've learned about the capacity of namco and what they have managed to achieve over the years it should be noted that and it's no doubt the ministry of education has played a significant role in the past to support namco e-learning content development as a way of increasing access to education in the country it's not just the matter of access we've heard from dr murangi the issue of quality control and the importance that we'd not just increase access but that we also improve the quality of our material and there is enough evidence today to show that nanco has done an excellent job and work in the field of e-learning in particular and development in general and one good example that we can all refer you to it's the well-known namco learners books which not only is on the ministry of education arts and culture catalog but it's also being used in many schools across the country ladies and gentlemen i think we can give nankula a round of applause the excitement of e-learning in terms of content that can be delivered through text images animation audio and video through the internet by using cds dvds and usbs of course accessible through personal computers mobile phones television cds and dvd players and all these media are nothing new to us we are surrounded by them especially in urban areas the reality in the situation in which we find ourselves now surely points to the fact that the concept of traditional education has changed and surely without a doubt new technologies and internet becomes increasingly accessible giving more learners parents and others students an option and a choice it is believed that e-learning makes learning not just simply and easier but also more effective and it allows learners to engage with content and also to interact with each other as educators we believe that the more engaging the content is the more stimulating it is the more interesting and exciting vibrant creative and innovative material the better learners will be able to remember it will be able to apply it we need to bring back fun into our teaching and learning activities whether it is in the boundaries of a classroom wall or whether it is beyond with e-learning but we need to bring back the fun in learning this not so much to appreciate these days people are feeling that we've lost a lot of educators it is true we've just heard about many of our educators whose life have been changed irrevocably by the loss of a loved one or themselves being positive while others have lost their lives we cannot underestimate the impact that covert 19 will have on our lives and in either way as education institutions as the education sector we must be prepared and today's launch is one of the ways where government has invested not just funding we've heard from the many subject experts the course the content developers the teachers they gave the time the passion their willingness we approached namco last year it started with a phone call to dr murangi and then after that regular engagements and planning but you can't just plan at one point or the other there must be action deliberative action and they really i take off my head to your team dr murangi and the technical team of the ministry who sat and worked through the initial phases to come up with something tangible we have to start embracing technology for the benefit of our learners and therefore just last year alone the ministry allocated an amount of 19.2 million to this project with the main aim of developing radio video and online resources in all subjects from grade 8 up to grade 11. what a humongous task for everybody involved it was not just complex at times it seems so frustrating and almost impossible but once again we've we have seen and experienced the resilience and the agility of our workforces in namco and the ministry of education arts and culture and so today we really salute all the 950 subject matter experts mainly our subject teachers as well as our education officers from all 14 regions none call of course played a critical role of spearheading the project which include the arduous training of content developers recording and producing the lessons in different formats the support in terms of laptops and data dongles for developers these were also provided director of ceremony it is absolutely fantastic that we can announce to you today the development of lessons that have been completed and are available for the use by our learners 360 radio lessons 285 video lessons and more than 3 000 notes for internet-based content developed on the notes master platform that dr murangi referred to the radio lessons are loaded on both the ministry of education arts and culture as well as namco websites and are also aired on nbc radio stations and various community radio stations such as the namco campus radio and unem radio we have heard now that discussions are at an advanced stage also to broad these lessons on other community radio stations such as rabbits fm karas fm radio energy west coast fm or my haki community radio unm radio in banduk and kunani community radio taking it across the country the video lessons are accessible via both namco and ministry of education arts and culture websites and the process to finalize the agreement with nbc tv for broadcasting as dr murangi state is underway all resources covered different subjects from grade 8 to 11 including the namibian languages and the technical vocational subjects director of ceremonies we are fully away is the ministry of the challenges our learners are facing with regard to connectivity data devices and other ict infrastructures in the country we are also aware of the level of ict skills among our teachers and the ministry therefore continues to put measures in place to address the challenges in order to maximize the use of the e-learning resources by both our learners and our teachers and i just want to say that this will not be the last time that you will find us on this platform the ministry and non-poll will continue with further discussions on capacity development for teachers in ict and we may be soon make another announcement that will benefit our teachers ladies and gentlemen i wish to thank the team under the leadership of ms ederborn formal education as well as namco in particular for doing an excellent job you can tick it off it's one of the key legacies for nam paul and the ministry is to have developed in such a short time span so much e-learning material we know that they will continue to finalize the development however the resources available can be utilized as from this day resources developed under this project i wish also to state this pertinently are open education resources that means that they are published under a free license that allows anyone to reuse them to copy these materials and modify them without any need to request copyright permission in conclusion dr murangi and director of ceremonies ladies and gentlemen i wish to stress that there is not just concerted efforts but truly genuine investment within the ministry of education arts and culture to promote e-learning as an alternative solution for sustainable life-long education you may wish to be assured that the ministry will continue to support namco either financially or otherwise to update and enrich these learning resources all for the benefit of the namibian child finally allow me to borrow from harold mayfield who counsels that and he says progress is a tight if we stand still we will surely be drowned to stay on the crest we have to keep moving may you all move with the crest and keep moving not to lose momentum and to bring education to our nation not just in the form of it being accessible but may we all move towards improving the quality of education in our country in all the respective roles that we are fulfilling with these few remarks ladies and gentlemen on behalf of the minister of education arts and culture honorable esther anandi pondoka i now declare the e-learning resources as officially launched thank you thank you thank you very much can we give the ed another round of applause please ladies and gentlemen what we are here for is the launch of resource materials but how do we access them where are they we talk of video lessons radio lessons we talk of notes master but where are they to answer that i would like to call on our on the namco side the project manager dr edward caripi to come and explain dr kharpie good morning good morning to you all for the established protocol before we play the pre-recorded demonstration i just want to explain maybe to the media that uh i just want to explain to the media that um although we are launching the the the resources today we are still finalizing and quality assuring some of the lessons and uh especi specifically in terms of radio and video lessons which are going to be which are available on the youtubes of both the ministry and uncle youtube there are still uh some which we which we are busy finalizing is in terms of quality assurance and etc etc but and also the uploading of the resources onto the youtube takes long so the team is still busy uploading and the youtubes have also limitations in terms of the number of lessons to be uploaded per day so it it it also caused some some some challenges but as i said we have developed a subject five radio lessons in five video lessons that is in terms of those two that is uh subjects grade eight to eleven we try to cover all the subjects including the vocational technical and uh european languages african languages which which are which are taken by by few number of learners yeah but we try to cover them in terms of notes master  the development is in the format of notes we call it notes it's like we that that is a whole syllabus development for each subject so you have to develop the whole just like writing a book so when we develop for a specific uh syllabus objective we call it a note that's why we are talking about 3 000 notes that 3 000 notes cover the range of all all the subjects of course it changed every day as the developers are continuing uh that process is continuing i cannot say that that is done so even if you are launching today is not necessarily that we are stopping today for for the work we are continuing that to a point where we say every everything is finalized and then we start again for for quality assurance and revision and so on that's how we do it in development so yeah we will now play the demonstrations we already pre-recorded the demonstration so that we prevent these mishaps of technology which might happen so yeah ask my colleague now to play the demonstrations on how to

 Sepideh program it's continuous professional development program there has been ongoing for two years in Uganda and we have a first ones actually Turin it we've been trying to pursue training midwives and nurses using mobile phones to upskill them to refresh their skills to impart skills that they did not have before or to just draw their interest to something that they had learned before without them having to go back to a classroom setting we really started it as a project that would be able to help the professional councils to implement the RCPD framework that is the nurses and midwives council the Grandda medical and dental practitioners council and they are light health professionals Council  I'm live was say conducted other I think simian answers and midwives who dropped the accountant and then it was put online and it was delivered us and other different institutions they made an e platform that enables an answer a midwife to just simply log on to the computer or mobile phone enroll be able to access the content read the content answer the exams and the quizzes and at the end of the day gets a certificate confirmed as attaining what he or she has attained in terms of CBD gone and study on the quizzes and did the exams I Paula fide what a certificate with them and this one has helped me to move on with my daily nothing and helping me my profession as an ass health training as has gone away from the regular classroom best teaching to the use of mobile applications online and yes at the same time I'm working so it doesn't interrupt tweet from my work and touch it at the pin so hopefully they come to my workplace to provide me at the same time I come here and said students come here on full on first office one week and then they go back so we also get a chance of following them up to where they work well give them support supervision to see whatever they do in their place of work we're really grateful to our supporting partners personally I'm so grateful to UM ref International University for their you know support to macare University to hustle to university it has really had a great impact and Johnson & Johnson just brought it all together and our leadership but the Uganda country office has really helped us to really have these great results that we're seeing today  
next generation global consortium it's really a pleasure to be here and we've really been enjoying working with the afrihun secretariat over the last year and are super excited to see this virtual community of practice launching today focused on e-learning i'm a professor of medicine at the university of new mexico school of medicine and also an associate director at project echo which is a workforce development and training initiative uh that started at the university of new mexico 20 years ago i'm just going to give a five-minute overview of of what the echo virtual community of practice uh approach is and a little bit of the history in africa and with the one health university network so you're seeing a screenshot of uh of the first echo that started in africa in namibia was an hiv clinical community of practice it started five years almost six years ago and has been running every week for the past five plus years with colleagues across namibia coming together doctors nurses pharmacists to learn together through a case-based learning approach to improve the quality of implementing almost a thousand different echo communities of practice in over 45 countries uh a year ago the global consortium of universities that are part of the one health university next generation network came together within a month of the announcement of the global coven 19 pandemic and launched in collaboration with aphra hoon and ceo hoon a series of webinars to share up-to-date knowledge on covet 19. uh there were over a thousand almost a thousand individuals from 54 countries participated in the first session there were 14 sessions seven for aphrohune seven for siohun colleagues from across the world joined to learn together in a real-time way about coven 19 and then just a few weeks ago as i said the african kenya team launched their amr echo on july 14th so really this is about moving knowledge and experience across countries and across continents so we can learn together and with that thank you and i wish you all well with your community of practice focused on e-learning thank you thank you very much uh dr bruce for every taking us through the echo at this point allow me to invite dr richard who should be taking reserve people and animals in the one health context all over the world this is the echo virtual community of practice model it's a very simple four component model that uses technology video conferencing to connect people across countries and continents in the world we're joining from all around the world today to really empower the agency of local experts and practitioners to share their knowledge and expertise it's a case-based learning methodology as you'll see today where participants will share real cases related to their personal real experience and and they'll be asking questions and seeking input from the community of practice to find solutions to the challenges that they're facing so it's a it's an all teach all learn approach where everyone will be contributing there will be a brief didactic uh by a subject matter expert who will share uh some best practices to reinforce evidence-based uh knowledge and then there'll be an element of monitoring and evaluation the fourth component and as winnie said there'll be a survey at the end of today's session a brief 10 question or so survey to get your feedback that the program planners will use to improve the quality of this afro-hoon e-learning community of practice so that they'll be a continuous quality improvement element to this learning approach it's a great opportunity to build bridges across ministries of health ministries of agriculture academic medical and veterinary medical centers the public sector the private sector you can invite anyone you want to participate in your learning community it's a great opportunity to promote interprofessional education to invite doctors veterinarians nurses epidemiologists laboratorians community health workers everyone who's part of the issue that's being discussed this is just a visualization of how we hope the knowledge and experience will flow in your community of practice it will flow in all directions this really is an all teach all learn approach everyone participating today is considered to be bringing knowledge and experience to the community and hopefully everyone's coming ready to learn from their colleagues people often ask how is this approach different from a webinar the main difference to me is thank you thank you once again christine for this yeah so colleagues now we've come to a segment where we're going to listen to our uh case study and also have a subject matter expert uh present me but before we delve into uh the case uh i would like to introduce our case study presenter dr harriet najimba from mercury university she's a lecturer in the institute of open distance and e learning doctor nigemba could you say hello to the colleagues yes thank you so much uh

institute of open distance and e-learning macro university with quite a lot of experience in both practical practice and research and e-learning so professor aminda could you please say hello to the colleagues so clicks i'm very glad to be here i'm very glad to join this community practice and i look forward to sharing with you uh about the topic of discussion today thank you thank you prof melinda uh so christine could we now go straight to the case study yes uh richard go ahead yeah thank you so much so um let me take this opportunity to hand over to dr harriet najemba to present our case uh for the day and after she will present for 10 minutes then we shall have a short discussion after which the subject matter expert will come in so over to harriet right richard thank you so much and colleagues welcome once again as i've been introduced i'm harit najimba from mercury university and i'm here to present a case study about modes of learning next slide please so as educators in sub-saharan africa we are having challenges and we said which better way than to come to this community of practice to uh you know to find some kind of solutions so this is why we would like to share our challenge with you so our challenge is that how can we as educators in sub-saharan africa design inclusive university education that accommodates all learners across gender and overcoming both geographical and infrastructure barriers and in these current coffee 19 health complications remember these require us to have standard operating procedure so how can we design this kind of inclusive education next slide please okay so as the slide comes up i would like to say that in mercury university for instance we have previously made hardcopy study materials available to students and we have blended these with face-to-face sessions in each semester we have also developed online study materials and we have uploaded these ones on the learning management system we have also gone ahead to use whatsapp and mobile phones to access learners groups and invite them to get login credentials so that they could easily be able to work online next slide please so going forward we would like to continue having printed hard copy materials and cds available for students and this is especially for those students who are coming from uh who are challenged by connectivity in the rural areas so we'd like to continue uh having printed hard copy study materials and we accompanied this with cds then we also want to use mobile phones and send learner support information so that we encourage students to work more easily on the learning management system we also want to have the occasional face-to-face sessions as we used to have in the past so that these ones help especially in the area of the practical components of the course but as we have this as our way forward there are a number of challenges that we need to think through so what we have to bear in mind is that of course the look down as a result of kovite 19 has made students go back to their homes and as we've said some of these homes are in rural areas these rural areas have unstable internet and electricity supply and for most of the international students also as a result of the closure most returned to their respective countries and some of these countries are still also in locked down and then the other scenario we have is that some learners do not have smartphones let alone laptops and in instances where a learner has a smartphone or a laptop and stable internet sometimes such learners may not always have the resources to access data and money used for buying data and so on the other issue is that although the university staggered students coming for the occasion of face to face we continue to have crowds coming especially for courses that have many students and yet the venues we have at the university not all of them are really that spacious to allow us have effective implementation of the recommended social distancing practices next slide so now the big question we have and that would like the community here to help us with do we have modes of learning that enable continuity learning i mean this a crisis so this is the major question we have and that is what we are grappling with and we know that this community of practice will help us get some solutions so thank you over to you richard okay thank you thank you so much uh harriet for that case so that is the question that we have given all those many uh challenges uh and um of course opportunities that may come indirectly without us seeing administering pandemic how can learning continue and i think we shall combine the question and answer um session after the subject matter expert has also come into try and give a shot at um the at the at the case then we shall open up this so let me call upon professor melinda to come in also make a presentation then we shall have the general question and answer uh session yeah thank you very much dr harriet najemba and richard our moderator and the colleagues that have joined this comment practice indeed the case that harriet has given us here raises a number of questions to all of us i think now we are witnesses to the fact that the the the in-person education system has been challenged is challenged and within this coved 19th uh pandemic the most hit sector i think to me in my my thinking the most hit sector has been the education sector and to countries like uganda which are still developing parents are stuck at home with children especially parents who cannot be able to afford alternative methods of delivery so our kids have been our children have been at home since march 2020 because we were not ready as a country for alternative modes of delivery so what we are used to are the modes of delivery where we have to send our children to the forward classroom brick and mortar infrastructure so that they can appear in front of teachers and be able to learn in that particular mode which is the first first mode but now institutions have been closed and so we have a challenge we must find solutions we cannot live like this we even don't know where the coronavirus or this panoramic is going to end uh it's going to end today or tomorrow and even if it ends so even if it subsides isn't there going to be another another another wave so uh to us as a comment of practice i think we need to devise means and methods of living with this pandemic and those other means this case study has been hinting on them on them the custody was able to hint on methods that are include that inc that are inclusive especially for our areas uh where we we do have challenges related to electricity challenges related to to internet connectivity i saw the custody hinting or no producing materials uh distance education materials and these are materials that could be written specially in an insta instructed in an instructive way materials that could be specially written and they replace the teacher or they don't replace the teacher but they kind of subsume the role of the teacher and these are sent out to students wherever they are and they can be able to work with these materials and find solutions so this mode of study actually is one of the forms of distance education which we normally call the first generation distance education so i saw that the case is trying to look at first generation distance education it's also trying to look at multimedia based approaches which use cds where we can record materials and be able to send them to students so in that way we are trying to avert or to mitigate the challenge or for the challenge of uh connectivity and then also the challenge of access devices because many people would wish to access the learning materials using laptops or using desktop computers but these are also not there in africa and in uganda you will find that less than 10 percent of the population has has desktop computers or have laptop computers but again the good thing is that the majority of our our people especially learners maybe in high education institutions the majority of them have smartphones at maker university for instance over 90 percent of the students have smartphones and so the case is saying yes can't we be able to get learning onto these uh onto these mobile devices the case is also trying to tell us that yes okay if you have produced the materials you've sent them to the lana's you have sent you have put solutions on on mobile phones and so on but what about feedback giving feedback feedback support supporting the learners because learning in [Music] in distance learning will be so isolated with the learners will be alone but they want to get a feel of other colleagues they would want to be supported so i i see this case learner support coming in so handy and ensuring that also students are working together because with mobile devices we do have uh approach applications like the whatsapp where we can be able these students can be able to create whatsapp groups and and also create their own communities or practice uh of communities of learning where they can be able to learn but they are learning through these resource-constrained environments and also we are seeing the case talking about uh blended learning or talking about issues of mixing technologies mixing approaches uh fusing approaches so we see you don't have to use only one approach so it is possible it's possible that within this pandemic we can be able to learn as i can see for from the case and the case of course is giving us challenges we challenges will always be there there is no solution there is no there is no aspect of learning or aspect of implementation which never has challenges but what the most important thing is for you to be able to conceive to see the challenges and be able to work around the challenges you cannot say i am going to wait for the challenges to to phase out before i can be able to take on a particular aspect so you have to understand the challenges identify the challenges and be able to handle each challenge one by one and then you can be able to amount and be able to to continue uh the case is quite rich uh in trying to solve especially issues to do with connectivity and issues to do with access and technology so that we can be able now to also move forward to use technology based learning uh in the face of this global pandemic and where technology is not so much available we can blend it up with a number of other available technologies we can be able to get the affordances to pick out to harness the affordances of available technologies to be able to reach out to learners that are stuck at home so i i can see that that that is what the case is trying to say and the case is trying to be able to solve challenges of learning within resource-constrained environments uh such as our as ours in uganda thank you very much over to you richard yeah thank you so much uh proof uh for for those comments uh maybe we can take a take on a few comments from the audience before before the subject matrix but eventually it comes to give a paper please if you have a matter you can raise your hand and you speak out that you can take on a few comments just now for about five minutes five to ten you raise your hand so that we can give you a chance to opportunity to speak out if you have if you want clarity on the on that case or you want to provide some solution to the challenge please do let me request the the the uh colleague who is putting up the slides what are the slide of the question the big question the main question put up that slide the last slide that had the question the colleague will share the slides the last one that had the question the the previous before this one the one that had the case study yes thank you so uh mama do mama do the hand is up please mama do you can unmute and speak out you can provide some kind of solution or if you want clarity on the case it can be clear yes please over to mama do please hello everyone hello hello i will continue in french because this place my language i wanted to come back to her concern that in this question because currently in the different universities it's a big challenge and he needs at decision to be taken especially to be able to go up to the learners for instance we've all have seen the changes caused by the pandemic that it's a healthy challenge and this has really affected us but we have to advance so if we come to talk about distance learning the challenge is most of our students live in rural areas and in neural areas for instance like in our country currently we are in a rainy season and there are hard the inactivities agriculture activities are going on and there could be a problem with us atlanta's being available also in senegal we have internet challenges especially the network which is always disturbed by the rains and the storms so this is a big challenge for us and we are saying for now we don't have uh solutions and we really don't have a a response to this question thank you all right for that is that many of the developing countries have and even the realness is on there yeah i know that proof my professor mind i will have a chance to talk about that brief uh talk about the supervisor i mean that professor i mean i can note that you have your comment but again if there's someone in the audience who has a solution because you would have the same kind of challenge where you are but this way you have approached it you're welcome to give it landry landry i see andrea hand his app yes please but i will also control french uh public health school we have a challenge also with uh distance learning and the biggest challenge is the coordination iron it is the same thing elsewhere uh and i think that's also a challenge with the rural areas and it's a big problem and also the internet connectivity is very poor and it is not active for instance last year when we tried it in the public health schools we tried the e-learning and the students are still learning much as we have the challenges but they are supported by the government but is true we are trying to do evaluation to see how e-learning compared to physical learning and we don't see a very big difference but we have realized that most of the learners they have challenges in following these lectures online lectures and the biggest challenge again it is always the internet connectivity we have a platform that we are using for distance learning and with the organization we also organized an activity of sharing with that involved at different levels for instance how we can do online learning and teaching but there is also a problem of covet 19 in the challenge but the biggest challenge we are facing is the situation of rural areas where we have students who in villages where the internet is poor so regarding that question that you asked those are some of the biggest challenges the biggest biggest challenge to us is the internet connection but we think the internet connection is the biggest problem especially for only those who are in rural areas but not the ones in the urban areas and it is the biggest biggest challenge that's what i wanted to emphasize thank you thank you so much uh lando you're also writing an issue that is within our organization's atlanta support which is an important factor in access but also there are environmental factors of uh distance and whatever that has been rural areas thank you so much i think we shall take on these two etobi and the fiona st and then we shall listen what is the chat then i give chance to subject my expert to speak speak a little so um hi everyone hi can you hear me yes please from the university catholic we also had the same challenges regarding the e-learning during this confident time we created a platform we tried to improve the internet to do the lessons but my question is in africa we're all going to say there's a problem of internet connectivity or connectivity but why are we insisting on e-learning and yet we could maybe do [Music] less lessons on tv on radio or by distance learning not necessarily online that's my question thank you yeah thank you so much uh italy for that interesting question yes why do we go into fifth generation when we can go to second generation because that's what is suitable for our context that's the question yes then we shall have thinner stay next and then we'll go to the chats yesterday retire siri hello yes hello okay so uh uh thank you so much uh for giving me uh this opportunity uh anyway so the coffee 19 came when we were not prepared so i'm i'm a teaching staff at university of rwanda i'm all i'm even a champion uh on this e-learning activities and uh uh anyway the the the challenge we had so the kovi 19 came when even at university were not prepared a lot of problems we had a lot of problems so like the one we had the biggest challenge we had it was iced infrastructures most of the effects infrastructures we had we're not ready to face uh uh that problem of of the of that caused by kovi 19 so even lecturers and even some students were not prepared you know to use those e-learning platforms they are so there are some knowledge or some skills you need to have especially for teachers especially the skills concerns material development to develop materials even to use those e-running platforms most of us were not prepared even even much media production we we didn't have the knowledge or skills that we we think would help us to to achieve but our university have tried in those difficulties and uh of course we we achieved some success like uh we we try to develop to develop materials and we are producing them even if they are not a hundred percent because there are some ways that you need to develop materials not just uploading anything you have among those achievements i'm talking about more than 27 000 students have registered on the platform they even tried to to to to learn through the platforms um the problem the big challenge we had the most challenging one was to develop some materials that students can even use when they are offline if they get a few minutes to to have access on the platform with richobando they have they can download and and use them later that that it's just the kind of solution i'm trying to to highlight so thank you so much yeah thank you so much for that yes we put them in forms that learners can download and use later as one of the approaches that you have in the university of rand thank you so much um christine could you just uh highlight a few issues that have come from the chat beforehand before i go back to the subject matter expert thank you richard uh we have a few comments i wanted to suggest that uh we continue to the subject matter expert because of time and then we can highlight as we move forward all right so you you'll highlight them later right yeah because we are running out of time thank you okay thank you so uh colleagues let me request the the subject matter expert then so yeah you can go to the next slide next slide please and next yeah so i'm going to call the subject matrix part to make his presentation but as he makes his presentation he can respond to the matters that have come up because many of them may are related to what i i suspect you could be going to talk about if it's not hinted on you can't hint on it but uh over to professor from individual from university he's also the deputy principal of the college of education and external studies will take us to a didactic presentation that fits into the whole syllabus of whatever we're going to be doing and also you provide some solutions based on what colleagues have said i think uh professor melinda we can do this in about 10 minutes so again we can open up discussion again of your presentation and that case that you can have a general wrap-up over to your profession thank you very much richard and the colleagues for the questions that you have asked present can we go to the next slide yeah so the question was asked to ask by the case study presenter are there any mods of delivery that can salvage us in the awkward situation that we are in a situation where our learners are stuck at home who are we going to wait are we going to have our students sit at home and wait until coronavirus is over or until this pandemic is over then there are going to be another pandemic so they are there of course there are solutions there is the first first teaching uh the agenda we are going to talk about there's distance education there is e-learning there is online delivery with this learning there's mobile learning there's virtual reality and there is blended learning which which we can look at next slide now uh first to first deliver it oh before we maybe before we i think uh richard are we going to get uh to to do the the survey the poll yeah if it's really just just a few minutes it can take just a minute or two and i think it was done if it is ready you can flash it the poll yes there it is there it is so so uh we we are trying to find out which of these mods you are most familiar with and uh one will be the the meaning not familiar with and we shall move along that scale up to five where where one will say i am very very familiar with this mode so you can be able to uh quickly answer this poll so we can be able to see the results of the the different uh modes that of modes of delivery that we can be able to use uh basing on the question that we we have we've been asked so which of these modes delivery are you most familiar with always familiar with so you can be able to quickly do this and submit so we give ourselves like uh 20 seconds because these are very few questions just answer them and then we can be able to see the results since i'm not the one actually running this poll somebody somebody somebody who is running the poll should be able to summarize for us should be able to generate the results and and display here the screen so that we can be able to see the film the the level familiarity with the different modes of delivery that we could be able to to pick on and adapt as we we as we move through this uh pandemic all right i think you can end the poll so that we then you can be able to display the results richard yes thank you so much can can could you uh in the poll and display the results okay so uh you can see that a first face is indeed the most familiar method uh there's no one who doesn't know about face to face uh go then distance education go down go down okay you can see i can go down actually distance education is somewhere there just in the middle there is a normal distribution that i can see here very very normal distribution and then the e-learning e-learning you could see that most of the people also are familiar with it and then online learning you could so also see that yes if you are not familiar with it just five percent are not familiar with it and then mobile learning uh you'll see that the majority may not be familiar with it virtual reality also the majority are not familiar with it uh blended learning uh you'll see that there's also a normal distribution there so okay that's good it's good to learn that uh there is a mixed mixed kind of group that we are having there are those that are familiar with most of these concepts and they're those that may not be familiar with some of the the concepts okay next now we all say that first to face is quite familiar to us because this has been our darling we know we know it's because it is the one through which were educated it is the one that we've been using to teach others and uh it is sometimes called presenting educational traditional or internal or sometimes we call it in person and it's the most common pedagogy that we use and usually it is mainly teacher centered and that's why when when kovid 19 came because we could not be together with the teacher all schools had to be closed and so this method this particular method is getting doomed because of the pandemic so next is uh the distance education somebody here raised a point which was very valid and said but why are we insisting or no uh going e-learning why don't we go through the traditional systems uh where we can be able to use the television we can be able to use the radio and so on or use materials print based materials yeah to be able to separate the learner from the teacher to be able to separate the learner from the institution that is offering them tuition so that we can avoid the coveted 19 infection by keeping a social distance as a result of distance learning so yes there are many generations that we could use but most cases you would find that many universities have jumped onto the fifth generation mode of distance education which is the multimedia interactive multimedia line we have jumped on the fourth generation of distance education which is the online and we skipped we've skipped the television we've skipped the the second generation which uses audiovisual and cds but these modes we can visit them we can visit them and go go back the first generation mode is the correspondence mode where you can write materials specifically and send them to the students and you can also send cds but the problem is because they were caught and were unaware writing materials for distance learning is not as easy as just getting notes or getting a textbook and you just send it to students it must be specially written materials and it also takes a lot of time so the easiest option that many people have phoned was was if i can get to the computer i can easily get out and reach to my students and so that's where that's why many people have run onto the fourth and fifth generation of distance education go ahead now e-learning and online learning uh these are open and distributed learning environments that utilize pedagogical tools enabled by internet and web-based technologies and this is where we have gone because internet is here with us and we are living in a global world we are living in a global village so uh many people have graduates many people can access internet so that's why a number of institutions a number of teachers have adopted to e-learning or the use of the use of technology to reach out to just learners the use of online systems to reach out learners because these are especially when it comes to use of if you use mobile devices which have reached out to most of the people in different villages but of course there are challenges related to it as we have seen here challenges of connectivity internet connectivity where somebody said when it rains in africa internet actually disappears but we will need we will need our governments to be able to move with the rest of the world move on mobile learning we've talked about it we have gadgets that are that are mobile that that allow victor's learning they allow learning from anywhere and so we can also use this there are a number of learning systems that have been created that can be ported on mobile devices and so that we can be able to enable mobile learning so this can help where there are challenges with connectivity where there are challenges with the lack of laptops or desktop computers move on move on now virtual reality of course this is more where we we are trying to to see how we can be able to do practicals or practicums uh in t
e online environment but of course as we have already said with our internet challenges uh it might be very difficult for us to to embrace this for now but already some countries in africa are embracing virtual reality where this is kind of a three-dimensional assimilation of a three-dimensional image or environment that can be interacted with in a seemingly real or physical way the the environment is not real but then it's made real within that with technology support with special equipment like a helmet that somebody can put on their head or gloves that they can put on and be able to simulate a real environment but in a virtual way that is good especially when you are trying to simulate practicals go on and of course blended learning this is where now there is a careful and thoughtful vision of face face and online learning experiences it must be careful fusion it's not just a mix you don't just have to mix because you are told you have to mix in blender learning you have to look out for the best from each from maybe each technology that you want to mix if you feel that in your settings computers are not available then you can say okay i can use a mobile phone but what can i use a mobile phone for not everything not every learning episode can be possible on a mobile phone but they are also that learning also those learning episodes which are very affordable on the mobile phone so it has to be a careful fusion you have to sit and think about it and before you can fuse but you can fuse the methodologies you can use technologies you can diffuse pedagogies so as you can be able to come out with the best learning experience next and so we can see that we have these different models where we have face-to-face that is supported with online solutions or you can have face-to-face holy almost the the biggest portion of your work could be face-to-face but then use online uh tutorials to support the first phase or you can have synchronous and asynchronous interactions go on so these are what we mean by what blended learning involves it involves blending pedagogies different pedagogies you can blend the constructivist with the behaviorist approach you can blend the connectivism with the social constructivism you can blend methodologies or you can blend technologies so blended learning is that careful fusion of all these uh three you can be able to choose one or choose two or choose three or choose all of them go on and lastly of course blended learning is what most of us in africa are choosing at mccarran university we chose to go blended because we do not have all the technologies that can allow us to wholly go online because it presents a number of opportunities for collaboration in a distance it increases flexibility it increases interaction it increases it enhances learning by providing uh different learning activities and providing improving again engagement of learners with their content learners with their learners and so on uh learning to be a virtual citizen is very very important nowadays uh gone are the days when you have to keep yourself in your cacoon you need to have networks uh all over the world if you have to survive in this competing competitive world so through the virtual learning we are able to connect up like now i am able to connect up with so many people here that i've never met before that had never met me and we are we are able to talk we are able to discuss because of this virtual uh network and making us virtual citizens uh digital learning skills are becoming essential to be a lifelong learner it's important that everyone become gets the digital literacy because that is quite important for us to survive in this competitive world and through blended learning we can be able to achieve achieve this okay next so i really want to thank you so much uh this has been a presentation which gives us some of the modes that we can adopt and to answer the question that is the case presented to us which of these modes can we pick home the number of mods it's not necessarily true that we should just go by the mode which uses uh online learning because we may not have the resources but there are various modes available at our disposal that we can be able to take on so let's evaluate the different modes that are available at our disposal to keep social distance to keep ourselves safe and to keep the quality of learning high because all those mods can be able to ensure that high quality learning is achieved uh thank you so much richard maybe if i can be able to talk over some of the questions that were asked if i still have time i will be able to talk over them but if i don't have them okay so thank you so much for for that presentation yes it's okay because we are again we are seeing the question and answer session now that we are actually in the second question answer session so it's okay you can begin there then i can add another comments that have come in through the chat you can first comment on what you have already there yes i have commented already on some some some issues already which was like electricity not there being no electricity then connectivity uh if we are to go online then our our countries have to do deliberate investment like we do invest in roads we invest in roads our countries invest in roads building of roads they must also invest in building the information super highway because it is also becoming a human right indeed internet is becoming a human right so we must as a countries must invest in these highways as we invest in the highways or of the roads then of course we have said blended learning can be able to support us where our internet connectivity could be source products spreading then adoption of online learning is not something that you just wake up and adopt in a single goal there must be capacity development capacity development for both the teachers and the learners many students with research we are going to resent use of online learning even many teachers also going to resent use of online learning because they lack the capacity to be able to implement or to be able to learn through e-learning go through online learning so it is important that we build the capacity of faculty we build the capacity of stuff we do our we we also build infrastructure capacity in our institution so that we can be able to have uh online learning or e-learning uh if we are to adopt that particular uh strategy i think that is that uh thank you so much prof minda when talked about generations just reminded me someone said that why do we go with fifth generation let's go back to you know our correspondence and i say that there are some contexts in africa where it is still relevant actually to send write out physical printed books and send it to our colleagues whom maybe places which are where we cannot um have um where internet probably is poor let me read some messages from the chat professor matthias cosey says that um we need to bring this aboriginal economic community or african union to help find solutions to reinforce electricity supply and just reduce internet costs so we're talking about uh partnering with the uh working with the regional bodies sometimes these issues are beyond universities they are beyond the countries and we need to work as a region another one says that the solutions highlighted sometimes the solutions that we come up with ignore the huge impact is between impoverished and privileged students one of the solutions posited posited will widen the already existing differences in quality of education between those groups between those groups terminologies like access to technology simply upset existing inequalities in societies and no matter how we spin the situation many of the students will never be able to attain proper education in a time like this of course 19. access to education doesn't exist in a vacuum it's shaped by large forces in society as one health network the solutions need to consider a wider set of actors and not only e-learning teams and idea i.t infrastructure yeah i don't know maybe it may not be possible to have everybody on board at the same time i remember when technology was anything that makes work easier now we have national exams for example and today mathematics primary mathematics examination is a mathematical set but then we have areas where learners don't even have access to mathematics but is it that we exempt those from national exams or we have to find solutions for them also through national exams we set another set of exams how do we make some all these come on board another one says that the problem is not only the connection but also the electricity or energy not all learners are powered in the same way but they're thanking you that like paul said we cannot wait for challenges to disappear and then work in the absence of the challenges despite the internet connectivity problems we can still try e-learning for this uh intermediate network we can use a mixture and that's what blending now i think of strategies take use of asynchronous technologies for students to log in when the internet allows and then back with their materials back with their mate we back this with materials that can be sent students by mail and that that's something correspondence all right so uh colleagues do we have the name anybody wants help something or professor mind any comment you have about what what i think the colleagues in the chat have just been providing solutions and suggestions to our challenges as africa so that i i just want to thank them for that particular supplement supplement to what i have presented thank you okay all right so anybody it'll be do you want to say something i see your hand is up probably that was something that uh uh sorry i think i did not bring down the hand i think i forgot the hand up i'm sorry it's okay yeah so colleagues as you have heard from the case and statement expert and over a series of these interactions we shall even venture at one time into trying to design uh learner-centered materials that help self-paced learning and i'm what indeed one of the learning outcomes of today's session was for us to be able to first of all distinguish the different learning approaches almost that are available and also be able to decide on which is probably suitable for our circumstances of course given the given that the environment that we're operating in if it means blending yes it has blend let us have material comparable in different forms and let maybe those who can electronically studies study electronically and those whom we can send the physical or the the cds uh also uh study that way okay so i thank you professor melinda for your eloquent uh discussion and the care of the case and also what you're presenting i thank you the audience for the solutions i thank the question the presenter for eloquently kicking setting the ball uh rolling so i think uh let me hand over to christine in the program so that you can give us the next uh way forward christian thank you thank you very much uh professor marinda and dr richard and everyone i think this has been really really very rich and just to assure participants that we've taken note of all the comments and the questions that have been coming in the chat room and we are going to provide solutions or comments or whatever it takes in a subsequent email that is going to come to each one of you so as we continue and get towards the end of this uh discussion uh just keep your comments and questions flowing in so at this point um allow me to i think invite richard and ken to take us through a survey and then from here we should be able to have dr irene or winnie to take us through uh the rapper thank you so much christine arcane could you please advise the colleagues on how to access the survey i've shared the link of the survey in the chat you can check the chat okay once again colleagues um if any of us is interested in a certificate after this uh we require you to take this survey but it is also important for us given the fact that we are going to have subsequent meetings or sessions please take up that uh survey it is very brief uh we can give ourselves i think three to five minutes and then um dr irene will come and give us uh closing remarks on winning in terms of the next steps thank you kristen yes please yeah probably maybe winnie can come in because she has that slide which she has to present as as the colleagues are filling in the survey sure thank you we need maybe when you can animate if you're trying to speak winnie hello yes sir we did not hear we did not hear you any mute very sorry about that okay so my mind is just to make announcements and then christine will invite dr irene to wrap up and close the session officially you have noticed that with this with the launch we have we have delved into content and we have had a very interesting discussion and very rich presentations but as you all know this is a community of practice and we need to be close we need to know each other we need to interact very actively and therefore we have decided that we in the next session will ensure that we have time for us to know each other a little better than we have done today we also have a platform where we shall share experiences we'll continue with the questions that have been raised make comments and have a very useful dialogue and that is called slack so once we have your details we shall get you onto the platform and ensure that we continue interacting even outside of these conversations that we are having so there are resources that christine will share in an email reminder in an email with you our next echo session will be on wednesday a month from now excuse me august 25th same time from 4 p.m to 5 30 east african time we shall before the session we shall share the agenda with you and we shall come up with preliminary topics that will indicate how our echo or virtual community of practice is going to land but these will be only partial topics because as dr irene mentioned we are planning to have a survey immediately after getting ethical approval and from that survey will be that will be administered to you and other faculty and institutional leads responsible for e-learning and will come up with the topics that are relevant that you would like us to share during our echo sessions thank you thank you very much uh winnie and thank you participants for taking time for remaining with us up to the very end allow me at this point to invite dr irene to take us through the closing session dr irene you're very welcome i have i've had to change laptops and this doesn't have the virtual background that i had initially but thank you so much it's been an exciting session uh professor mianda that was really wonderful richard thank you so much i think you tickled us we um if you open up a discussion i'm sure there would be engagement for the next one hour but we have to respect time and i'm hoping that we'll continue with this momentum chris has promised to send through an email with some of the comments but uh it's been an exciting session where i'm sitting in my capacity someone who engages in african programming but also management and leadership it i was i was noting a lot we've not only appreciated the different learning forms but also we've appreciated the challenges that we face on the african continent as far as e-learning is concerned and these are enormous but also the there is a ray of hope as i was reading the chat there is hope in uganda there is a program i don't know whether it's still on which says that literally i'll translate it later in english that you're not poor but it's your head it's your head it's your head that is poor so we have here brains that can put together solutions i've been chatting to colleagues at work how we are not only struggling at university level but even primary schools how kids are tricking us some of them are you know they submit work which they've not even done and so it is it is a problem that is not only at the university but we can together come up with solutions and i'm hoping that at the end of this um i don't know whether community or practice ends we'll have to engage gross to see whether you can put an end to this but i'm hoping that as we evolve we'll be generating solutions that even surpass university challenges but also to to cut down to to to primary schools because now it is a way of life as we've had i've enjoyed some terminologies everybody's becoming was it what citizen is it in a virtual citizen you know it's not only the university community but the even school level uh secondary primary everybody is becoming a virtual citizen and i know it's us at the university that are going to generate some of these solutions that is good that are going to bring digital literacy i also appreciated the need for that and from afrahun's perspective as we move forward i was noting um some of the the need for capacity development not only for students but for faculty and i'm hoping that we'll have a discussion on this as we move forward in programming what kind of capacity does it need in terms of human resource then we do we need to do to to develop and what can we do as a frahn of course the issue of also infrastructure capacity which taken i know professor mean i didn't go into detail on this but i believe it takes different forms internet infrastructure gadgets those computers and phones and i don't know what else ipads so we can those are some of the things we've noted and of course there was a chat i don't know i don't remember the person but the person was questioning the approach to just engaging e-learning team although i had a question for him like what is this definition of an e-learning team the e-learning team and iit and going beyond to engage other stakeholders i appreciated that comment a lot coming from one health i think my stakeholder engagement in e-learning is going to be critical as we move forward and as we design these solutions as we come up as we put our heads together to deliberate on these solutions we need to think outside the box let's think beyond the e-learning team i'll get to the name and maybe have him expand on that but the e-learning team can be also diverse it can involve others different disciplines so let's think of our stakeholder engagement who else can we bring on board how can we engage the private sector how can we engage service providers and what discussions can we have so from a one-half perspective what can we do as leaders in one health to bring together to facilitate this much stakeholder engagement in e-learning it's been exciting thank you so much um we take old um have a report to our ceo professor brazil and and the professor cabasa and of course to our partners to see how we can support these processes you've ticked us uh professor meander you've really stimulated us to discuss i hope i'm praying that this um doesn't fizzle in the next one month that will return with follow-up discussions on what we've learned today thank you so much i wish you all um a pleasant evening i i don't know whether i hand over back to christian or i closed the meeting at this point you closed the meeting okay so uh with that are you taking a group photo i don't know how you do it online just please everyone can switch on the camera all right so the meeting is closed but i'll hand over to kenneth our i.t at afrocon to to see how we can capture um i think he's managed manipulating it from his side so thank you so much on your cameras please thank you [Music] yes hey thank you everyone thank you and bye thank you [Music] [Music] bye is
 attech Mondays Africa is supported by the MasterCard Foundation Center for Innovative teaching and learning and is part of the Master Card Foundation young Africa Works programming social media has become an integral part of young people's lives in learning institutions of the learning institutions in this case online and offline and in other spheres of their lives they are connecting in different communities using social media tools but what are some of the benefits of social media what kind of impact is social media having on education and learning welcome to this edition of edtech Mondays Africa where we're coming to you from the United States International University of Africa or usiu Africa as it's commonly known and we're here to find answers to some of these questions do the benefits of social social media outweigh the negatives and what are some of those regulations we need to have in place what about the policies and joining us for this conversation we have Dr Collins odar assistant professor Information Systems School of Science and Technology here at usiu Africa and we also have Karen isim who is an undergraduate student pursuing Information Systems and Technology majoring in cyber security and forensics she's a Rwandan citizen uh here at usiu Africa we also have Martin chaten who is also an undergraduate student data science and analytics usiu Africa and a Ganan citizen we also have in our audience a number of students who are here to take part in the conversation but let me start with the big question to all of us social media is here it's not going anywhere it's probably getting more distractive uh for all of us but I want to know how are you using social media as as Learners as undergrads and soon to be young people absorbed in the work environment let me start with you Martin I kind of use these social media platforms very much I could say like in a day I spend almost like 8 hours on WhatsApp on maybe IG all it LinkedIn because I like you know building my portfolio and I think it's the best thing that has ever happened to the world of technology because um when I was in high school it was only WhatsApp for sharing you know other stuff but then now as I speak I've been able to leverage and linked in a lot of connections have come as a result of my presence on LinkedIn so like I feel like um social media is just tremendously influencing the space of learning how is social media being utilized for you as as a learner within the campus I get PRS in order to complete some assignments and then I get to meet um people who who are advanced in my career like data science and analytics you see um it's a new field that is really evolving and for me to really advance myself in that career I need some connections so basically what I said about Link in like I have met so many people who are also mentoring me in the field of you know um data science when it comes to WhatsApp I would say sometimes I kind of forget about assignments you'll be there and your friend will call you hey Martin are you done with question two I want you to help me in that before I really you know recall that hey we have an assignment to you know submit so it's kind of um a reminder like people used to you know call me like yeah for me to do my assignments and H submit some stuff on time and I also utilize because here in us I I have to be frank in every course that you do you would have a WhatsApp group so I I have done like 20 courses and I have 20 WhatsApp groups we share ideas we work in groups teamwork and collaboration and I think this is what is preparing us for the world of Industry 20 WhatsApp groups Karen how many WhatsApp groups are you in and uh how are you utilizing social media on your end I am in more than 50 WhatsApp groups 50 50 I think 5 Z more than 50 yeah wow so the way we use this uh social media I can say about WhatsApp that's where we connect with my colleagues so my colleagues uh they can help me um just to learn they can share with me the videos that they have seen on YouTube and also um when you go to the in in you can be able to connect with this expert I can say like social media has really changed my life everything that I that I have right now it was because of social media to get the scholarship links I get it in my WhatsApp from one of my friend and um to get other um social social Venture rings I get it through Instagram so I was just like it's connect me to other people that I can't meet them physically 50 WhatsApp groups how are you able to coordinate all this stuff what's going going on in those WhatsApp groups and on average how many hours do you spend in a day on social media I spend more than 10 hours on social media so it just like shifting from what I'm doing uh let me say I'm working on assignment and then oh I saw a popup message so I go on WhatsApp I go on YouTube think how I manage these WhatsApp groups uh of course they are or related with what I like yeah cuz I can join with the think that I'm not associate with some of them are related to what I'm studying so related to school others related to what I enjoy like entertainments Dr Collins o thank you for making time to join this conversation from a lecturer's perspective let's talk about some of the benefits of social media because I I believe that they're quite immense and outside of the average time that they've admitted to using social media for what are some of the benefits from a lecturer to student side as a lecturer as a faculty member we are one of the biggest beneficiary beneficiaries of social media in education and especially education as the students have actually confirmed to you we now communication has now become very easy now we are able to communicate with them form them in a group in every class and able to communicate uh or pass information to them as also amongst us as colleagues we are also able to peer communicate with each other in the department in the school and even the university wide so like uh personally we have uh I'm in the school WhatsApp group I'm in the University wide WhatsApp group and of course with other for the other students so it my work has become very easy in terms of reaching out to this student directly because social media gets Us close with with each other in terms of breaking the barriers do you feel that maybe the level destruction could be a little bit higher on the students end and how are you managing that do you start your lectures by giving them pep talks or how does it usually go there's a curriculum that has been shared there's a syllabus that followed so now we have to use our different me pedagogies to teach so the students attention is actually arrested in class without getting distracted in terms of either giving them group discussions teaching the actual teaching process so that way they don't get distracted but the technology and know that's one of the disadvantage of social media is destraction and maybe spending a lot of time and those who are not very careful they can actually waste a lot of time using the technology you've talked about some of the uh benefits of social media from elur lecturers perspective and then also lecturer to student perspective are there any dangers that you envision what do you think could be the most harmful areas where social media is concerned as much as technology is good you have to also be aware of some of the challenges that it brings maybe distraction a matter of time wasting so those who are not very keen they spend their time on things which are not educational because it social Med brought everything on the world together so there's that time wastage for the students who may not be very keen uh maybe another also cyber bullying is also very is now emerging now cyber bullying and online crime is really emerging and I can see most cases now being reported about safety on Online safety so that could also be another big challenge you interact with these many different communities that you're in um and sometimes you probably study via Zoom or even the other platforms like teams how does that work for you do you feel like you're able to achieve the same experience as when you're interacting with with your peers in a lecture room um the problem comes when you find out that the lecturer has there is a digital Gap so you are not able to start on time and finish on time and there are instances where you know Zoom allows for only 40 minutes straight work then you go back and join in people tend not to even join others also because of soci social media when even we are in class people don't tend to you know Focus what of being in your own you know environment your room where you're on your bed the lecturer is behind you in the virtual environment and now he's speaking and it's not like you are all maybe on video it could be like we are all maybe we have switched over our videos and we are even enjoying our cool music your mic is muted unless maybe the says hey you will answer this question before maybe you you you come in so the experience is quite different and it's not really positive for me to say because um me for instance there are two instances I felt like the lecturers handwriting wasn't good even in class so using the virtual environment it was so poor I couldn't even concentrate so I have to just sit back and give myself a date to rise what he taught in class so it's good because it serve as an alternative when there is emergency but then it's not it can't be compared to the benefit we get in class because in class you feel like your whole thing is really in the mood to steady and you're able to physically ask questions in and out but on Zoom you could possibly ask question but your microphone will just go off that is technical issue and communication becomes very difficult to do so I think yeah the physical class is having so many positivities as compared to the virtual environment dror do you think the benefits outweigh the dangers that that that you've talked about I really appreciate the benefits of social media as a faculty member it has really helped me do my work easily I be able to communicate with my students I be able to collaborate with them and I feel I'm able to reach them at any time apart from even the official hours they could meet they could reach out to me at any given time so the benefits of social media are overwhelming the disadvantages usually what are your biggest concerns when it comes to say your final your finalist students some of those in their fourth year what are your biggest concerns when it comes to their usage of social media today's learning is about uh is student centered learning it's not like long time when I was learning when was the lecturer s you yeah so this time it is two way we learn from each other and now social media has now opened up the education sphere so students are able to get more information they're able to diging in that mine a lot of information so it's not a matter of being worried as a lecturer but just giving the student the space and actually today's learning is are more of research research based so inquiry based learning so we need to empower the students to inquire more to know more information so that when they come to class we share and discuss we look at how that knowledge can much applied to them are there challenges you experience as as a student when it comes to social media reduce the focus when you are studying when you are focusing on your work um so I said I used the I spent more than 10 hours but those popup message but uh also there is other tools which I have seen which helps you to make off those notific questions so that's the one that I have tried to apply I'm no longer being here losing my focus you're no longer losing your focus all right I want to bring the conversation to us as students and I can see Jennifer is is already noding here probably we can pass her the microphone so my name is Jennifer Bessie and um I'm a bit different from the field in which they are yes so my major is psychology and um Tech has really helped even the psychology field because now in our classes that we being taught about um technology we found out about the cyber bullying and we found out about a lot of mental health issues so we found out that even on social media especially for teenagers and Learners they now start to compare themselves with what they see on social media and that has been a very worrisome thing and we found out that there's a lot of disadvantages that affects the development of children because of screen time so now even psychologists are looking into the number of hours like they're saying like Martin is saying 8 hours and then we have current saying 10 hours plus so look at this if a child is going through that how many hours of the day they're using on screens for their eyes for their development but one of the advantages we found also most of the advantages we found about social media is now that we have online counseling because with the limited number of psychologists that we have in the world around and the rising mental health issues we found out that having this online us areu Africa is so good at that because of the Counseling Center I was trained to be a peer counselor and now we are able to have online counseling session with people that are way away from us that we can have physical contact with them but you can still be in touch with it people to help them manage certain mental health issues so even though it has distractions it has a lot of mental health advantages that it gives to those of us who are in the psychology field interesting um anyone else yeah I'm seeing um you my name is Grace magaza I am majoring in international relations with a minor in criminal justice so my contribution is very much similar to what she said although I will be arguing from an international relations perspective in that there's a duality that we seem to um Overlook when it comes to the use of social media and this is that the challenges that we're talking about they exist to actually challenge our intrinsic values as human beings when they were speaking about their use of time on on social media that to me as as a student it it sends an alarm in my mind that how how strong are my values the moment that I see myself spending more than 12 hours unfortunately on social media my question to myself is not that social media is bad it's that my capacity to hold on to my value of discipline is not as strong as I think it's supposed to be and then on the other aspect is that there's something about realizing that there's a is a there's a bigger picture in international relations we say that the world is bigger than you and if you want to win in the world you have to understand the world so social media more than anything it has given us a greater way of understanding the world in a way that our forefathers did not understand it in the first place which is why it is such an incredible tool even now in international relations for things such as public diplomacy we we draw cultural practices of different countries just by being in the comfort of our homes and more than anything during Co social media transformed our capacity to work as human beings and if we look at social media as something that is either good or bad I'm afraid that from a policy perspective we're going to be polarizing it and social media is a non-living thing and if we polarize it we're going to have to choose it's either right or it's wrong but at the end of the day at the center of all of this Plato says that at the center of all human decisions is a human being so more than anything I think that we need to evaluate our use and gauge how strong our intrinsic values are instead of polarizing social media as either a good or a bad tool because if we do that at the end of the day we're not going to drive cars we're not going to fly to different countries we're not going to try the incredible food around the world so my contribution in a nutshell is that there's nothing bad or good about social media social media is a tool how are you utilizing social media platforms for your or to your benefit selling yourself as a brand what I've tried to to do is I take videos of uh myself daily trying to share what I do as a person so that it it makes it easier if I share my CV with you um you can get to go and say like okay let me do a bit research on this person if you end up on my account you'll find out this is what he does in a day like I will even put this in a day you see so someone gets to know okay this is how you spend your day you wake up you do this you do this you do this so it helps Learners I think share a bit a bit of yourself to the work environment and it shows other people what you're practicing and what you're learning cuz at the end of the day you have this opportunity of sharing this is what I learned today and this is Monday this is what I learned today and this is Tuesday in your communities do you feel like you are learning something additional that is related to your course the advantages and disadvantages of social media is still at 50/50 it depends on how personal I take it on that when I was in my first semester I was trying to understand what happens if I take a lot of time on this social media learning just understanding my course specifically and that one through my and I decided to go further and find a way how I apply it I actually did my first project and I just want to share something on that and my project was to understand what is the effect of different parameters on the performance of a student who attends classes and among the parameters that I had I had two specific parameters one was the about the number of hours you spent on social media learning just trying to go through the academic related context and the amount of time you spend on social media just doing other things on the adjustment you come to realize that someone who takes more time on the N academic related performance it's likely to have an effect on your performance because you come to realize that your focus goes down and your are level of attention in class might it's likely Disturbed and you don't have enough time to work on your project so I would say that uh it depends on a personal responsibility how you view it how you use it and how you take it because it can be really really good for you and a brief to your academic performance because I personally take it as my second lecturer in all my courses Dr Collins O War your students are talking about making money and they're also talking about the distraction how are you as a university regulating do you have like downtime during examination period or how how are you able to regulate the the Learners in this case knowing that they have data bundles that they can buy on their own for the course I'm teaching is application social media and business in our in our school of ss so one of the activities I'm giving them to do is to look for organizations that are completely not used utilizing social media and they make sure that they bring they give them around five channels and train them whatever they learning in class to impact this is called transformative learning we try to do that in US yes are you so back to your question um of course this is a free Society very liberal and of course you cannot block them from the rest of the world we not going to do a disservice to them so uh maybe in the exam the university rules are there for the examination that they're not supposed to use their phones and other other Technologies unless the exam is open book but we give open book we give questions that they able to think through and apply and give the answer on the responders browser or on the answer booklet yes so they doing the class time they also know there also class rules yeah they are supposed to put their phones in silence and maybe could put them away they're supposed to be active so also during class time we try to engage them with the group discussion with content discussion so that they're not really that they're not taken away they're don't us that time for class to do other social media stuffing like for entertainment and based on what you've just said you know the there's the attention spine I'm sure um if we had this conversation for two hours after 1 hour some of them will walk out walk out of the conversation is the same happening in the lecture room and how are you navigating that part because they know they can go onto a social media tool with additional content and be able to access the same thing you're teaching so how are you navigating the reduced attention span and still be able to achieve the same as a lecturer say in terms of the learning outcome the Master Card foundation with the partnership with us has really taken us as through a number of this training on how to handle this students some of them are J and some are millennials yeah so we have been told been trained on how to handle them pedagogical skills so one one of the things personally I use a lot is I go through the content the syllabus that's provided by the university this the cext it has activities so I know there's that time I have to plan very well within that lesson time our classes here are running that we have two Blended two classes there's those that go 3 hours and those that goes one and a half hours so with good planning I always find a way of arresting the attention the discussion the application so they have no time to to serf good planning uh to the two of you over here do you plan and say uh during the lectures I'm going to access my phone I'm not going to check no popups are going to come in the way of of my learning uh today Karen does that happen to you as well do you have to be intentional be disciplined about how much time you're dedicating and even when you're accessing additional content about cyber security and forensics when the popup shows up on your device do you immediately get distracted and switch into something else forget about what you were you know uh reading about before how does it usually go and how are you able to remain disciplined I like uh USA AF cuz it gives you um the opportunity to choose uh the class uh the class time so for me I prefer choosing uh 1 hour and 30 minutes that class session so within that time I I know myself I can be able to discipline myself and be attent be attentive in the class and also um I I try to block uh those notifications so that you can't dist trust me and um yeah that's what I do for me I feel like um in every class I have this attitude for any class I go so if I feel like the lecturer is someone who likes talking like content based lecturers who just pour the content on you like that then it leaves me with no option than to only switch off the notifications because for me how I program myself is that no matter how I'm taught in the class what I will get is what I will get not in performance yeah I know myself and I know my capacity my attention span yes I can listen to some um a lecturer for like 4 hours on average I can say 3 hours I can really concentrate for 3 hours without being distractive grasping everything but I feel like if you're a lecturer and you come to class and you want to always P you don't give the room for people to show like ask questions interact with you get to know more into what you're saying then I feel like I have to take my phone not really go going to social media but then do some background stuff which is maybe related to no related to other CA maybe I have the next class in next 3 hours or 2 hours I would just start revising that c and still be in the class yeah because no matter there are slides there there other complimentary sour resources there is YouTube that is the beauty of you know social media yeah I'll be able to catch up and make your 100% for you in the exam let me uh pass the mic over and please help me respond to this question in the days or in the days when you're doing your exams during the exam period are you still able to concentrate with all the social media tools that you have access to it's upon a person to say enough is enough enough is a decision there's nothing like enough enough is just a decision you decide you say what I'm done right in my own field like there's no way I can live without social media cuz I'll be learning one thing upon the other upon the other I'll see how he used the camera I want to learn that how he did that I want to learn that how he show that I want to learn that so you would see like on an average she used 12 hours I would consider that I use more than that I use more than that like all the time you find me editing learning when I learn something new from the social media before I do it I'm not leaving my laptop I'll watch that tutorial for more than like 5 minutes I'll watch it again and again and again and again until I master it on my laptop I'll download a lot of apps to make sure that I finish up my assignments all to that what I need to do so you ask me a question do I concentrate during my examinations so if it's a practical one yes I concentrate on social media right so if it's not if it's for reading maybe reading yes one thing I do this device in my hand I leave it home in my room I go to the library I switch off my Wi-Fi discipline is so important do we have anyone else from the audience would like to make a contract i' would like to hear from the ladies as well I use a reward system so that I ensure that um I concentrate on my cewor so I'll study for a stand number of hours and then I I use social media after I'm done with my study session so that I get I use it as a break for myself so I'll make sure that I concentrate and grasp what I'm studying so that in the end I get to use my phone go through my socials and stuff then come back to reading so that system helps me to do my cewor and at the same time I get to use social media for entertainment purposes right so you try to strike a balance I'm going to take one more comment from the front over here personally I feel that USI does a great job in the digital literacy education because once in our orientation we uh we go through how to use the various platforms across usiu and how they specifically tailor them so that students can be able to use them and it has been so helpful as also professor said because it's more of how are you using it for the right purpose at the right time and it's more of so that you're engaging more with the right resources and the right content on social media and leveraging it towards your your learning and your education as well and something else that I also give credit to in terms of social media in uh specifically to the Apple ecosystem is that I am able to tailor my different types of do not disturb modes on the Apple ecosystem such that I have a learning mode where it keeps me away from everything and I am specifically concentrated to my notes to my learning resources it has been quite helpful as well as usiu as one of the measures it uses during the examinations is we believe that with time we need to move as well and it's no longer time to write exams on paper anymore so in usiu we do have online exams and the which you can even do remotely via a responders browser you can even do it from your home because you have a webcam which is usually monitoring your audio and video and as well as it's so locked that once you try to exit it will save submit your exam so it is one of the control measures that you also usiu is using that it's leveraging technology but to a limit that it's also allowing for development as well as not going backtracked that thank you so much for that um dror I know that you know in the outer space outside of the learning institution that is usiu Africa um there's also the element of policy because it's through the policy that you're able to it's able to Cascade down to the learning institutions do you think that the policies that we currently have in place that support the education ecosystem are supportive enough to continue the positive impact of social media because remember we come from a world where mobile phones are not accepted in certain learning institutions and even where they are there are with so much red tape how do we make sure that from your side you have as much freedom to utilize these smart devices but at the same time fall within the bigger umbrella of policies that support the same I think um most institutions in higher education ESP in Kenya have actually not developed uh social media policies for the University and actually the basic education secondary and primary have said it's even a crime having a phone in some schools is it but at least us you stud allowed to have their phone is it you can have your pH but I think there should be more policies that should put in place mational right with the regulator like commission forers education the inverses themselves and uh to help promote the use of social media because already you're using it and you're using it positively yeah to encourage student to use social media to to encourage the lecturers to use social media to collabor with each other and share information with the swedents also so I think there's serious need for policies both National and and institution wide policies to promote the use of social media thank you for that Karen I want to hear from you going forward because to all of us who are in the room today one thing that's happening in the workspace you see once you leave usiu Africa instead looking for a job out there and you absorbed into a certain work environment what's going to happen is that when you try to open a Facebook app be locked out you try to open WhatsApp You' be locked out if you try to open Instagram or whichever you'll be locked out until after office hours as Learners in the room are you starting to prepare your minds for that or should you say you start preparing you for that because I mean you access the internet everywhere on the Camp right going forward how are you preparing yourselves for the work environment with all the Temptation coming from from social media the policies for social media uh in USU are perfectly fit with what is outside at the workfield so for the school it's preparing for me yeah to be able to go to to the field and be able to walk work those uh 8 hours without using social media though uh yet I for me I'm in take field of course uh those information to get social media I take it as a way of consuming information you are consuming information to me social media that's what it means so um at the workfield I will spend I hope I will spend more hours using social media just to share information and also consume those information Mar when you're disciplined everything kind of works for you no boss or maybe employer would like you to be in his office that he has paid a lot of money for giving you resources and he comes around to see that you're on WhatsApp and all this stuff Well's time is running and he's paying you according to the time you spend and being productive in that office so um us IU is really helping with students when it comes to social media usage on the positive side that's what I have to say and then I think how I have positioned myself in the field of learning I'll never be distracted when I go to the field because taking myself as an example data science and analytics I'm being fed with a lot like volumes of data to analyze for the company even it is going to go deep into my leisure times my you know when I even I go home outside office I have to be still working because I can't in that 8 Hour span do everything when I have a large number of you know data to analyze to create dashboard to create models for companies decision making so social media would just I think I will even transition from social media to my work you know yeah because I'm not going to balance I w't be able to be productive even for 20% of what I have to do when I have to combine social media with my work so on average what would you recommend is the limit for me my 8 hours is perfect and it's very because it depends on where you are number one I use GitHub a lot I use LinkedIn a lot so my 8 hours is not just on chit chatting and all this stuff it's really productive and I must assure you um I have really gained a lot of experience and opportunities I'll be going to India in December and it's just through social media everything is c for I don't feel like I should limit my eight hours on social media but I should make sure in that span of eight hours I'm being productive I'm gaining what I have to gain from that yea
 I don't go yeah for social media to use me I have to use it we're going to take okay I see how many more comments from the audience social media is something that usiu Africa is teaching us as a Psychology major is that we are being told that you can never have a client and have your device that's so disrespectful and that doesn't create that conducive environment so in as much as we spending time on social media strictly in Psychology class our professors will not allow you to Too Much be distracted with your phone because they can tell that it will interfere with your work ethics if you leave because they say if you are addicted to your phone now in class and that your professor is teaching you something about psychology and understanding human behavior and you can't discipline yourself first then it's going to be a problem so us are you Africa even if I have to speak for the psychology department actually trained us to make sure that you your individ as an individual you're disciplined enough to put your phone away and concentrate and we are been trained for me I want to be a child psychologist and I want to reduce screen time for children it must start with me that if I'm supposed to be with children for 8 hours which last week we in Maple bear a Canadian School in Kenya for that hours you're with those children they must not see you on your phone so that's a face tof face communication so those practical experience that is given to us by us IU Africa in our volunteer that we do trains us actually not to rely too much on social media um so there is some sort of training that's that's started already or is already ongoing um for me I want to speak on the policies that you asked about and arguing from an international relations perspective you know unfortunately the law is reactive it's not predictive in nature so for us to have policies that are guarding the use of social media would have to transition from the natural um the nature of the law itself which is that it is reactive so now if I was to become a policy maker and talk about the kind of policies that we want for the use of social media I have two answers which is that we need protective and productive policies protective in a sense that there was a Harvard study that was done that our our neurop Pathways as human beings are not able to adapt as quickly as the emotion not emotion but information overload that we have from social media and that is harming us so if we could have more protective um policies which are informed by Neuroscience that would actually help us to gauge the use of social media and by productive I'm going to Echo what um Martin said that it's important to understand what you're using social media for so maybe if the law could step in allowing institutions of Higher Learning to gauge the amount of time that Learners actually spend on social media by actually blocking some of these apps when you're on campus or even ensuring that they monitor any harmful activity you know um um to digress a bit um Chad GPT when you use it there's a there are some topics that it does not allow you to ask it and that is because of the policies which are in place AI policies so if the same thing could be mimicked with social media that when you're on campus you're not going to be selling drugs to people you know it's these grassroot things that actually can tell us how well we are doing with these policies um and so we can conclusively say that the impact of social media is more on the positive side and so what needs to happen is just the discipline and the regulation for it to work better where we're talking about the younger generation those who are still in elementary school I think that's where Jennifer's expertise needs to come in there has to be uh a parental guidance rule uh on that front um to just take care of the regulation the screen time to make sure that the Learners there are using social media for what it intended for I'm going to give the last word to Dr Collins o all right yeah thank you very much I think uh this topic is very very informative for both the Lo and the students and actually as the V we are now really on ways to to use this social media in and promote the usage of social media education uh technology I'm from the ICT side for School of Science and know technology involving now you talk about social media already there's now conversation on AI also CH GTP student using a Char GTP which is now also the on the table on the now on the now and of the policies to be developed but one thing as I emphasiz as a lecturer this was my Parting Shot I really emphasize on soft skills I really try to stress this to my students doing things without being reminded be self-disciplined be productive if you g an assignment all this will override the negative part of the of the usage of social media so that's what my pting shot that I keep on encouraging my students uh to improve on their soft skills so so with soft skills they able to conquer any negative sides associate social media in education absolutely and I think I have nothing much to add in addition to that but one thing is for sure that these Learners have demonstrated to us that the impact of social media is more on the positive side than we are seeing on the negative side thank you all for joining us in this edition of edtech Monday's Africa my name is Joy durin Bea and until the next Edition thank you all for watching and thank you to the United States International University of Africa for having us here and to all the students who contributed to this great conversation thank you all and we hope to see you sometime soon bye-bye for now attech Mondays Africa is supported by the MasterCard Foundation Center for Innovative teaching and learning and is part of the Master Card Foundation young African works programmming 
so okay i made the decision because i know it's important for that us to have a good stand in the health field and also the journey so far has been adventurous so much curiosity but i promise you whatever curiosities you have will be answered and then it's an interesting one so all those who have not decided i'll just say make haywire the sunshine and then make this decision first in time so has not to lose out of it and then the earlier you make your decision the better for you well as um a diploma knows i've been looking out for an opportunity to have my degree for a while but it has been difficult so when this idea came up i was happy to hear about it and i was glad to i was glad to come and i'm happy to see you well i'll tell them his view is happening live and is wonderful so they should come and be part of it it's very good to be a partner of a change that is happening i'm so happy i'm part of this and i will encourage every other person that is here to go for something like this that this is a change and starting from where you encourage them to come and join the train uh let me see this opportunity to welcome all the students that we're expecting to be part of the great history we're trying to make in oau over female university uh elephant nigeria is my great pleasure as the vice chancellor to welcome each and every one of you we are very quite sure that you are in for a good time especially in the annals of history of high educational learning in the world obafe miolo university is one of the pioneers of the distant learning program in nigeria now we use a combination of different modes of multimedia technology to support a delivery of the material right from the point of application to the admission to receiving the lectures to the reading to computational results utilize ict utilize electronic needs essentially each student will have his own tablet the lectures are already pre-recorded the lecturer goes into our studio apart from that the lecturer would have been informed so to say the same way it's not the same way that prepare your lectures for facebook materials very very interactive and then after you know that you prepare the powerpoint slides you take you to our studio where you hold the lectures the student creates up the purposes all these purposes that are principled at the up-to-date target with the powerpoint slides from the site so the student which started he's seeing the lecturer he's hearing him and he also has the books so it's actually some advantage the student in the regular classroom he sees his lecturers natural part in a 1000 capacity lecture theater back and say that they can rewind this as many times as possible so that is really an added advantage over the conventional delivery stage of development you need a scaffold we need a scaffold to be victims of going beyond what we can imagine we see in the industry the opportunity to start scaffolding that item between dreaming about carefully studied the proposal we have almost 20 or 20 proposals from different industries and carefully scrutinize and explain their solutions consider this future is critical for bangkok but it's actually a determinant initiative for nigeria being a microcosm of africa if there is elearn the product would never have been cheaper because everybody will be in the different places and there will be no 300 girls gathering together in a very vulnerable part of the country for somebody to go and kidnap if they're still learning knowledge actually filters through the air unseen by the forces of its progression who would rather keep us backward in the stone ages because they don't know so they feel that nobody else should know it's like somebody who has poor eyesight i feel that every other person should go blind because of that and so e-learning for us is not just a question of choice it's actually a matter of survival it's a matter of national security it's something that we can use to develop the own developed tables it's something that can go to the earth rituals that can touch the untouchables and that can achieve otherwise in you
we are going to give ourselves a few more minutes to wait for other colleagues to join so bear with us let's give ourselves probably three more minutes as we wait for other people to join thank you by saying that we have a french interpretation so please if you are french speaking be sure to get down to the globe sign on your zoom and you will be able to see uh click that the icon will bring you different languages and then you should be able to choose french as we start this meeting let me know if you can hear me in case if you can hear me kindly type one in the chat then i should be able to proceed okay good thank you thank you all right so again once again you're very welcome and uh i would start with taking us through a few housekeeping rules that we want to follow i have been projecting them already but just to re-echo them for our own good as we start this meeting okay sorry so this session is being recorded and uh we assume that your attendance is consent for this recording and thank you so later on after this you know presentation after this session we are going to share the recording but we shall also share a number of other materials including the slides with you on email on slack but also on the group whatsapp the e-learning community of practice group whatsapp and in case you have not joined any of those please feel free to send us a message even today but even on email we shall add you on slack on email but also on whatsapp we usually give a certificate of attendance uh so in case really you would want this certificate we encourage you to take a survey there is a very short survey that we give at the end of this session and we shall share a link for this survey takes less than five minutes and after that we shall be able to give you that certificate the information we get through that is very important for us and for us as a community because there are a number of questions we ask that would help us to better these sessions moving forward we also request you to register your attendance later on colleagues will share a link in the chat uh please open the link and uh register yourself so that we are able to know who attended and follow up with you and this data again is very important uh for the betterment of these sessions later on and once again i should mention that we have french interpretation and in case you need to switch to french when you go down the line you will see a globe icon written on interpretation once you click it it will bring a number of languages then you are able to choose french or english but i should mention one change one of our speakers today i think the first one is we'll be speaking french so the english speaking team from the word go once he starts it is advisable that you go to that globe icon and change to english because he will be speaking french thank you very much so having said that i want to request any members that have joined us for the first time and you have not introduced yourself before please open your mic and uh introduce yourself in less than a minute your name and the institution where you're coming from and we are happy to have you the rest of the team members we may not you would introduce yourself in the chat but those who have come in for the first time please open the mic and introduce yourself just in less than a minute then we should be able to start thank you and over to you colleagues good afternoon everyone i am juvenile country manager rwanda happy to be here with you all thank you thanks doctor thank you any other patrick any other person who would want to introduce themselves yes please and the doctor dr i'm the controller for the upper project apple cameroon thank you thank you chad very welcome any other person all right okay the other persons will introduce themselves as we move along uh in the chat room okay so allow me to invite richard who is going to take us through the next part the agenda and introduce broadly the topic today's interesting topic over to you richard yeah thank you so much um christine i hope uh i'm audible yes you are yeah so good evening and good morning ladies and gentlemen welcome to the ninth session of the afrofun virtual community of practice sessions uh today uh our agenda is very brief we shall have a case study presentation from mr desjardins then we shall have subject matter expert didactic discussion and a question and answer session and then announcements at the end so shall we discuss the topic today that i will discuss is online tools that enhance e-learning and learn experience now many times we put online courses online and put content online but forget the interactivity and participation of learners or sometimes we tie ourselves to the discussion forums only so if you're using motor platform but there are quite a number of tools online that can help to serve the same purpose you can enhance learner participation and experience using very many tools online outside the learning management system outside the discussion forums that we know and maybe the chats so today the session is going to introduce us to some of those tools and we think it is part one we shall also have another part where more tools will be introduced and so we look for a very very interesting and practical session so that is our session flow and um as usual we begin our sessions with um a case study to kind of like set their base for the discussion that we're going to have and our case study today is going to be presented by mr uh desiree embarco from the catholic university of central africa that's in cameroon he's a coordinator of the licensing management audit and control and the preparatory class for management studies at the faculty of social sciences and management the department of economics management and information systems he has here some online courses so it's going to set the face by presenting the yesterday in the next few minutes so allow me at this minute to invite my friend and colleague and mr evoko israel is over to you desiree  good morning good afternoon everyone you are hearing me i hope everyone is following what i'm saying like our colleague has just said i am from the catholic university of central africa where i am the coordinator of the bachelor of management audit control but also the preparatory class for the management studies in the faculty of economics and management at yawunde cameron i have been asked to present a case study for this session online tools which improve the learn online learning and experiences of the learners so i'm going to talk to you about the experience of the catholic university in central africa this presentation which i'm going to make is going to be divided into three parts i'm going to talk to you about the context in which online learning was started in central africa then after that i'll talk about the challenges in the second part the major challenges which um we face and the third and last part i will talk about some questions that need to be answered when a person is preparing to teach online or learn online the context of university catholic has already been explained to you because this is an institution a university a national institution a university that was created by the bishops of the sub region the central african sub-region it was created by the headquarters in vatican in collaboration with the cameroonian government during the time of co recovery 19 teachers um were obliged to put their um courses online urgently in order to respect the sops that had been put across by the perunian government the catholic university had already had a small experience about online um learning through the model platform most of the lecturers did not have the necessary skills to teach online specifically they did not know how to make the students participate how to display them in terms of the time and then attending lectures did not know how to help them do the exercises and the guided work and also to assess them so they did not have those skills so what they did was to put all their documents in lms and the virtual classes through the tool the zoom tool and this was done just accidentally therefore this is a very short step helped us to um come up with the necessary challenges to identify the necessary that challenges um that was supposed to be averted one of the major challenges was that of reducing the volume of applications which are put on lms so that those documents can't be easily exploited by the learners who happen to be the target the second major challenge was that of ex improving the experience of teachers or tutors together with the learners online because in that context at that catholic university it's well it's like dipping in the water in the deep waters so we just um started accidentally without discovering major challenges that i can talk about which we need to think about uh while um talking about online teaching and learning this leads us to the questions that i'm asking the participants and myself as well the first question is that what are the online tools that can be used to improve online learning and teaching as well as the experience of teaching online at all levels the next question is linked to the first one it is related to the first one how do we mobilize those tools once identified and then the last question is that what are the constraints that an institution an organization must be aware of or in order to use the tools for online teaching and learning i think in the term matters of the catholic university that is what i managed to come up um and present in this session and in this ninth session thank you very much thank you so much you've followed me very well yes we have thank you so so so much uh for that um uh kind of like uh basis or foundation for our discussion today what are the tools that canadians and learning and probably how can we manage them and what challenges can come with those tools now i don't know that any member of the audience has one comment because you have one comment about the case do you need any clarity you need to reaffirm any member of the community if you have any point that you want us to clarify regarding that case we can currently request a desire to clarify if you've got something to be clarified about the test maybe you can raise the handle type in the chart okay so i think um the case is um is is clear maybe our at this juncture like to request the subject matter expert to do a kind of like validation of the case a validation of the case uh by the introduction maybe i can introduce our subject matter expert at this point she's dr kim welsh work uh from arizona state university she's a lecturer there she's in the department of innovation and imagine initiatives she's an instructional designer an expert who has taught fully online hybrid and fixed classroom classes for a long time in both in both english and french and sharing higher education and she taught her first fully online course in 2006 our role now is to train faculty from several african countries labor and costa rica as they move to online platforms and she likes she loves interaction and engagement especially because it helps to see the brain of participants so she's really an expert she's a practitioner she's a scholar in online learning so uh dr kim i would like to welcome you to first of all validate uh the case over to you perfect thank you so much richard and thank you daisy for explaining so well the things that happened during covet at the university so this is this is helpful i'd like to see in the chat if you're comfortable typing in the chat if your institutions i know that you're from pan-african countries um you span the whole entire continent tell me if your institutions felt the same issues that deserve a has explained here with these questions and challenges in the chat can you say that we had the same experience a big yes from christine and please put in chat if you feel like you had the same experience as what desiree has explained here where during covid um you ended up having to put a lot of things online and maybe you didn't have the training that you wanted with your faculty to be able to do that in a way that um made online learning interesting and helpful for people so just to express you know the same the same thing happened all over the world of course as things shut down for um covid even where i am i i work for arizona state university but i live in southern california and during covid i was actually tasked with training faculty how to put things online and they had the exact same experience that deserve a um was explaining here so well they put everything online so all of their content went online but they didn't know how to interact with the students so they felt like it created a barrier when you're in face-to-face classes it's easy to know you know you can ask your students questions they get to respond to your questions it's easy to see that they're following along but in an online environment it takes very specific tools and strategies to be able to see this online learning take place with your students to be able to get to know your students so a little bit of what i'm going to do today is explain you know some of the things that i look for to make online learning more interactive so we're going to go about that um we'll look at some of the constraints as desiree was mentioning some of the things that happened things that you need to think of as you're choosing tools that support online learning and one really positive thing that i want to say that has come from covid is you know so many people put content online and that's actually the first step is to digitize your content so that people can then download it online so you have that first step already now it's just adding that layer of interactions and capabilities so that you can know that the learning is taking place online so that's what we're going to go through a little today just with fair warning and if it's okay i'm going to start my presentation in just a moment um we'll start a little early i will give you a little fair warning that you are going to be interacting today and this is a little bit of a stretch sometimes because most people are used to um just getting spoken to in an online environment and that's not what's going to happen today i'll speak to you briefly i have a short short presentation and then we will have some breakout rooms where you're going to actually speak with each other so you're going to be part of the program today and that's exactly what i want to represent for you is how to make learning happen in these groups and environments so that learning happens between this the community of learners so we're going to go through that i'll share my screen now and give like i said a very brief uh presentation about things that i do to kind of help people understand how to choose their online tools so uh by way of of course you know representing what i'm doing online tools that enhance e-learning and learner experience that's the title of the presentation so we're really looking at tools um my doctorate is in learning technologies and so with that doctorate i really love to find tools that support learning in a learning environment again i work at arizona state university but i do live in california um so when i'm looking for tools and especially tools for interaction so again this is the level up so now that you have your content online you want to start interacting with the students and engaging the students so there are certain things that i look for and i'm going to go through those first um one thing that i look for is the types of interaction um moore came up in back in 1989 he came up with a model for interactions and he found that there were three things that students online really need to interact with one is the content so um the the content that you want to be able to interac get the students to interact with the content when you put your content up on a learning management system you don't know if they're actually reading it you don't know if they are actually interacting with that content so for example an interaction with content if i have a video or a reading that i put online and then i create a small quiz for the students to interact with that content they get to know more about the content and and it leads them and guides them so that's an interaction with the content it's not just putting the content out there it's actually kind of making them or forcing them to interact with the content through a quiz so that's one type of interaction i also look for interactions with the instructor so the instructor if the instructor is for example even an email can be an interaction with an instructor so that's one online tool used for interaction with the instructor feedback is another thing that an instructor has a direct communication and interaction with a student by giving feedback to for instance a paper or something that they've done so there's interaction with the instructor and lastly there is interactions with others so we like to create a community of learning and if they can interact with the other people in the class they end up learning more and they get more invested so i look for these three types of interactions sometimes it's just a single interaction but if they can interact with all of these so they get to interact with the content the instructor and the other students those are my favorite tools and i look for those i also look for tools that help me to see their thoughts so if i'm in an online environment i can't necessarily ask them a question and get them to answer immediately and so if i can get a tool where they have to write down their thoughts and i get to see that on my side that helps me to know if they're learning or if they need help with anything so i like to get a tool that will help me to see their thoughts and there are other considerations that i have as well one is am i teaching in a synchronous or asynchronous environment so synchronous is like this right now where we are on zoom and i am able to present to you you're able to ask me questions and we're here at the same time um asynchronous environment means that maybe they are accessing the the platform or the the interaction at a different time so they're not at the same time as each other so asynchronously and if i look for tools where maybe it works in both scenarios so i like to do that i also look for tools where it can help with their um if they have any bandwidth issues and especially as i work with africa there are places in africa and even times in africa where maybe their internet connection is low and so i want to make sure that it's something that can work online and offline so they can download it they have to have a little bit of connection of course they can download an item and then they can reload it so that or they can interact with it either offline or in a way that you know when they come back online the interaction is there for me to see as well so i look for that um as i choose my tools too especially if i have students or learners in low bandwidth environments i also look at cost cost is important because some things are very costly um so i tend to go for the free things if possible if not the very low charge so i look at that and then another thing that i look for is am i able to support their needs for digital literacy with this and what do i need to do to support their digital and their digital literacy needs um so if they have special needs i i want to make sure that that's part of the way i instruct and you'll see a little bit of how i do that today and so we're actually going to use one of these tools that i've chosen that i feel fits all of this so all of these things that i've represented we're going to use the collaboration of google workspace and you'll see how we're going to do this i'm going to walk you through it on a very simple level first and then i'm going to have you expand so that you're kind of on your own doing this in a breakout room together so i'm going to actually exit this we're going to look at a google document and i'm going to give you an example of how this is done um i am going to move this presentation for just a moment and i'm going to give you this google document in just a moment i'm going to put it in the chat so you'll see the link in the chat and when i put that link in the chat you're going to click into it and you'll be on this google document if you've never used google documents before please note that is it's a collaborative space meaning all of you will be on this document at once and i'm going to be able to see what you're thinking i'm going to be able to meet you here on this google document and we'll be able to you'll be able to tell me a little about yourself for today i'm going to have you write your name in this left column and then in the right column i'm going to have you tell me how you participate in online teaching and learning so you're going to just give me a brief explanation i've given you example here an example um and this is the way i kind of support your your needs for digital literacy if you've never been here before this is exactly what you're going to do you're going to write your name and and then give me the example i train faculty how to teach online and i teach english and french courses that's me so you get to know me a little bit so i'm going to share this and up here in the right side i push share i come down here and i say get link so i it's anyone on the internet with this link can edit i copy this link and you'll see it in your chat you should see it now so if you go to the chat i want you to click on that link and it's going to bring you bring up this environment and you'll see right here i know that someone has clicked on it because we have just a little icon showing me that someone has clicked on this and so when you come in again you're going to put your name here in the left side now notice here so we have a personal bait you're going to want to actually go to a different place and this is kind of confusing because there are a lot of people in this environment so you can scroll down and pick something that's a little bit further down and start to write your name if you see that someone is typing in a space try to try to get a different space for yourself and i'll give you just a minute to do that it takes a little time to get in there and start start typing so again the question is how do you participate in online teaching and learning and this can be the classes that you teach or the way that you are supporting online teaching and learning if you're an administrator or staff and please feel free to write in french as well hmm now remember the link is in the chat so if you haven't come on here yet you'll want to practice here first because you will be coming over into your own breakout room with other people and you'll want to know at least how to do this now again you can scroll down on this document and find any empty space there should be empty spaces below as well i love this the first time people use it sometimes they get they start to get you know it's it takes a little moment to be able to get your space in the right the right place and be able to not type over each other so but i'm using i'm learning a lot from you so um it looks like we have people who are teaching on zoom which is very helpful so that's good we have people who are training teachers in online pedagogy that's fantastic i use whatsapp to share ideas on a topic as a group so whatsapp and that's something that i'm not as well versed in and so it's always fun for me to learn from people who are using whatsapp to teach so i i like i would be able to learn from you a little bit on that bitcoin to brian um so you learn from experts winnie fantastic uh so jane you're developing an online course for the afro-hoon and ohw academies that's fantastic um and i don't know jane is this a course that is uh how to teach online or is it a course where they can then take that course and teach it themselves uh no it's for students to take a course on outbreak investigations fantastic thank you jane um so many courses on on zoom cristela very good and they honest it's always nice to see you here thank you i'd actually know be honest assistant lecturer and apart from that e-learning champion um he trains academicians how to develop online modules and train students and teachers how they can use different lms fantastic financial accounting and a blended approach richard great and then monique you've you trained people and the experts in online teaching very good um i teach epidemiology that's great and then penina support staff online teach online load content online use of moodle whatsapp google forms and zoom excellent very good and let's see it looks like eliane said  yes so if you click where someone else is typing so so here he's asking um is it normal that when you click on a space within the google document um where someone else is typing you can type to yes and so you always want to try to find your own unique space so that you're not typing over someone and that's a good thing to get to know about google documents since that's how that happens and hopefully for the translators i translated that all right so this is great um that you were able to get on here and uh go through and at least try your handout in this um so this is one way of interacting and again it kind of goes through those things that i suggested before um we're talking about online learning and so you're you're interacting with the content i get to see it so you're interacting with me you get to interact with other students and that you get to see what they are they're typing as well so that's what i really like about the google platform is the way that we can share and collaborate that way so we're going to go to the next level now and we're going to do the same thing with another example so i'm going to give you in just a moment um a breakout room google workspace and you're going to go into that breakout room and you're going to share a little bit more with each other um the breakout rooms are not open yet i'm going to tell them when to open the breakout rooms and before they open the breakout rooms i'm going to give you a google document but i want to read through that google document first so the first thing we're going to do is read the instructions of what you're going to do in that that breakout room and then you're going to um we'll teach you how to select your breakout room and you're going to go into if you're english speaking you'll choose groups one through four um so you'll choose either one two three or four you'll be able to see how many people are in those groups try to find a group that has fewer people so we want to have about four or five people each group so you will choose again english it's one through four if you're french speaking you'll choose group five and you'll go into group five and then you're going to find the group page that coordinates with your breakout room number so here's a description or i'll show you what that that looks like and i'm going to show it in both i'm going to try to show it in both french and english here so give me just a second so that i can get it you can see the instructions in both french and english so if you're in english you're going to choose just a second to get this in the right space there we go so if you're you're going in english you're going to choose um the the group page you'll notice that you have a lot of pages here when you get in this and i'll share this link in just a moment if you're groups one through four for instance if you're in breakout room three and that's your choice you're going to scroll down on this page until you get to group three here all right so group three is where you're going to interact with everyone else in that group you'll turn on your microphone so that you can talk to each other the first thing you're going to do and i have the explanation over here in french as well you're going to spend two or three minutes just getting to know each other because it's nice to know the other learners that you're working with the person with the shortest family name is going to go first so that we have a model who goes first and then that person will call on the next person to be able to introduce themselves so that it's not quite in the room we want to make sure you have a leader in that group and then you're going to spend 10 to 13 minutes talking about and listing technologies you have used or have seen used to help students interact so you're going to talk about things that you've used i noticed on that previous page that some of you have used zoom some of you have used whatsapp and there are maybe other technologies that you have used or seen used that you will be able to list on this so you can share the technologies you'll come to this sheet over on the left side you'll write the name of the technology if you can you'll also check mark off so you'll see these little check marks here you'll check mark what types of interactions it allows for instance zoom might allow for all three something as simple as even email might allow for instructor the the students get to interact with the instructor something like whatsapp you can tell us which and which ones of the interactions that goes with here and then give a brief explanation as well if you can also give us for example here if i type something like padlet people who know me know that i like to use padlet you can also put a link to it if you'd like by just highlighting it coming up to this space and pushing here on the link and then you can add a link if you want to send us directly so you'll notice that i've done that here with google workspace we have a link where you can actually go out and see what google workspace is about so and i saw in the chat day-to-day you've asked how to get into the group i'm going to explain that now so for the first moment at least i want to share this link so i'm coming up to the share space i want to make sure that everyone can edit that link and i'm going to copy it so the first thing is to find yourself in that space so in the chat click on the link that's in the chat and you're going to be able to find this document so that's the very first thing that you're going to do so again in the chat you should be able to find the link and i see a few people are already in there or a couple um click on that link in the chat and you'll be able to access at least this space and i'm going to stop sharing for a moment while people get in and i'm just watching the numbers on that google document to make sure that there are enough people getting in there i see about 12 people in there 13. so again if you you're not in there yet in the chat you'll see the link to that document and you'll be able to get into the document now um ken is nicely our we have a great id person so ken is going to open um breakout rooms forest so ken if you can open those breakout rooms if you're english speaking you should be able to see so he's opened the breakout rooms if you can't see a little thing that comes up just yet that says breakout rooms at the very bottom of your zoom screen you should see something that says breakout rooms you can click on that and you'll be able to see the different breakout rooms that are there if you're english speaking choose breakout room one through four you can do that by just clicking on the word join and you'll be able to join that breakout room and i see that people are starting to enter fantastic if you are french speaking group five will be your space so please go to group five if you're if you're able to i've seen some people are in there and if you are having a hard time ken is going to assign you to a group to go in and be able to do this now again when you get to your space so when you join your group make sure you scroll down to whichever group number you have so for instance if you are in group 3 or breakout room 3 go to the group three page and that's where you're going to collaborate and now some of you are being assigned a group if you're assigned a group and um you can just push on that little uh space you should be able to join the group so you have to actually click on the button to be able to join that group so alain rose victor you'll want to join your groups looks like elizabeth as well penina and samba new as well very good and if you have questions if you're still here and you have questions feel free to unmute your mic you
can ask questions someone would like to know how to go to the chat how to app how to access the chat oh the chat okay perfect if you look at the very bottom of your zoom screen so you have to be able to see the zoom screen so where my face is at the very bottom there is a little uh space that says chat so you can hover at the bottom you might not see the the icon until you put your cursor down to the bottom and you see chat does that help i'm seeing more people join fantastic and let's see um rose oh good rose was able to go in along all right because there's still a recording going on um i'm i'll explain a little bit of what i'm doing so i'm watching what's going on within the the uh google document so i'm able to look at that i'm also able to look to make sure that people are in their rooms um it looks like we have a few who haven't been assigned just yet let me see or not joined i think the rest of the two remaining interpreters abby and sarah perfect okay and if the interpreters want to go into their respective groups it's fine or they can stay here either way there is because these are separated by languages they don't necessarily need to be in the space unless they can answer questions perfect um from my side because this is being recorded and i want to make sure you have this recorded um i can watch what's going on within the space when they start to actually put things into the space you know at first it's just introductions but um they can i can see exactly what they're typing um i can even ask questions about what they're typing um i can go in and and uh make comments on what they're saying so that's kind of a nice aspect of this is i get to watch this i can also and i might um in just a moment after some of their introductions i kind of like to go over and um go into their breakout rooms to see if they have any questions if i see someone struggling a little bit i will go into the breakout rooms to see what types of questions they might have as they're as they're working through and can i notice that there's a countdown of minutes up there i don't know if if it's possible to um to raise that just a little bit if not it's okay okay i'll raise the minutes to like i should add five more minutes uh yeah let's add probably three to four more minutes so maybe make it 11 or something just people sometimes it takes especially if it's the first time they're in it takes them a minute just to figure out what it's all about so we'll add just a few oh they the requesting from group one for help perfect i'll go into group one thank you let's put all broadcasts so i'll broadcast a message to say that it's closing in about one minute okay look all right i'm closing the rooms people will come back in in about 60 seconds um we have about 10 seconds left and everyone will enter the room mhm perfect welcome back nothing new um if you you might need to choose your channel again um if you're coming back from the breakout room maybe you exited the channel so you might need to choose your channel with the globe at the bottom again to make sure that you're going to get the interpretation that you need i am so pleased with everything that i'm seeing on this document so many people have put great things here um i'm going to share my screen for just a moment to show you all of the great things that you've been able to put here um so it looks like you had some conversations in your space and you talked about the different technologies that you used for instance i see a lot of whatsapp and google types of items i also see slack and zoom microsoft teams canvas miro which is one that i enjoy doing it's a little more complicated emails of course um i see moodle telegram mentimeter which is kind of a pulling software it's nice i also see forums different various uh assortment of things and of course in french as well we have discussion boards um just resources that they get online um collaborative work uh the the mind mapping so mind mapping is one as well and then just in general the online learning so you've put several things here and i really appreciate what you've got next thing i want you to do is to notice so scroll through again so i'm you know if you're not on the document anymore i'm going to copy the link and i'm going to put it back in the chat um so it's the same document that you've had already but i'm going to show you something that you can do now so that even though you know you're finished with the actual breakout rooms and projects you can come in and comment on other people and for example right here i can highlight this and you'll notice that over on the side i have add comments and i can comment on this specific one so i can say you know there's a i like to use discussion boards too right so i can come in and comment um and i can do different things so you're you're interacting again not only with the instructor but you can interact with others as well so if you want to scroll through and say oh i've never heard of mentimeter how do you use mentimeter you can put that as a little comment right on this side and maybe you can follow up with that person later so it becomes a nice format for interacting with each other i'm interested how did it go for you and you can put in the chat was it confusing was it easy did it help you did you like it put some comments in the chat as um about your experience with the google document that you used or feel free to unmute your mind if you want you can unmute as well was it easy was it difficult tell me in the chat bonjour hi desiree yes madam  good morning good afternoon can i speak yes of course we have a problem of the sound i can't hear you can i give my opinion can he hear so i am to do online learning was that of infrastructure like electricity during the same session we had power cuts and the internet connection was also unstable those were two major problems obviously both with the students and the teachers obviously very good there's another problem that i talked about in my pro presentation i do not have the skills to conduct these online lectures we just put a document online we did not have the technical means to work on it so that the students can exploit it so we just put it online this is important there's also the availability of students they are not disciplined everyone comes at their own time so i stopped there to let others also speak yes and thank you desiree these are difficult and i'm i'm actually going to before others um want to speak about those same issues that you had because they are issues that i think everyone has felt a little bit with this i do want to say that um with google especially there is an opportunity to work offline and i will give you um this this one's in english so in the chat i'm sharing um the english how to work offline and i will also give it to you i believe i have it in french as well give me just a second to get it in french it will take me a second to find it in french there we go copy link so you'll have to forgive me i don't have my french keyboard on so i don't have the accent marks but the the second link is in french this is how to work offline with your students and for a quick moment i'm going to show you how to create a google document so that you can see what it looks like to create the google document and then students can work offline with this google document as well so i'm here in my if i have if i'm uh if i have a gmail account so anyone with a gmail account has access to google documents which is really nice i'm going to share my screen quickly here so and i'm going to try to do this both in the french version and in the english version so as long as i have a google or gmail account i have access to the google document space um i just have to type and i'm putting this in the chat so you can see it if i type drive drive.google.com i have access to google drive i can create something so if i want to create something new i go here to new and i can create documents spreadsheets and presentations um in french it's nuvo and same thing documents spreadsheets and presentations over here unfortunately it does not um translate that very well and then when i create for instance a document i can share it just by coming to this link i'll give it a title and then here i want to make sure that everyone can edit this when i copy the link and i want anyone with the link to be able to do it so i always like to have it anyone with the link can edit i copy the link and then i can put it in a chat i can share it i can also put it in for instance canvas or moodle as a link and then people can work offline in the spaces and then it will they can work as collaborators it can go online as soon as they get into an online space so there is a way to work offline so if you have low connectivity desiree or any of the rest of you there is a way to work offline with google documents and then all of your things that you're working on will upload as soon as you get back into good internet connection so i i did want to say that and make sure that people knew that this does have offline capabilities thank you for that dj are there other questions about that or do you want to respond to deja desiree's issue of the fact that you know students aren't as disciplined maybe because they aren't coming to class in the same way so you could give a comment on that as we watch if there's any other question coming through so oh you want me to give a comment for me it's very important to make very strict deadlines for students and to consistently reach out to the students so um because you no longer have that attendance thing going on right so there's they're no longer attending you don't see them in front of you how are other ways that you see that they're interacting with the material and that's where this interaction comes in when i can see their brain i know that they're there so for instance if you were my students i would be able to say so based on this document i'm going to share my screen in just a moment if you were my students and it was important to me that you participate i would be able to see your names here and i would know exactly who participated in this activity and if it's a point-based activity then they're more likely to be able to participate or want to participate because they know that it's important for them to pass the class and so these interactions become an important part of keeping the students responsible for their learning and making sure that they are interacting with the content in the way that they're supposed to so that's my response but other people might have responses as well yeah thank you so much for that yes any comments yes yes yes you can either raise your hand what time in the chat comment about what dr kim has presented she has ended by showing us how to create that document yes so we can now go and create it then we experiment you had a question i wanted to yes i want them to ask um you are you you are saying that richard might be on a different channel oh sorry yes yes i wanted to you have seen that okay you you have seen that you have i like your presentation very much thank you very much for that presentation you've said that you can be able to to monitor the students when they are in class by checking their names at the the side of that document that you have shown the students are the ones to type in their names they want to put their names there so you can so that now you are able to know who has gone in or how do you know how who puts the names of the students on that document this is true so they can cheat and put their friends names if that's so if that's what you're talking about spiranza so they can actually so for me i have them type their own names here um and then i coordinate it with a list of participants in the class so i look at all of the people who attended the class make sure their name is on that list just by going for instance here on zoom if i'm in zoom i can go down to the participants list and see that you were all here so if it's a synchronous session i can see that you were in class and you put your name on this document and you you filled out whatever task i gave to you so that's one way that i would be able to grade your participation okay that is okay unbelievable using you zoom or i can post it um for instance if i want to post it on the learning management system moodle or canvas or blackboard whatever you use i can also post it and it can be done asynchronously so students can then fill it out are there cheaters there are cheaters some people will fill out for the friends so it's not 100 guaranteed that they're filling it out for themselves but for the most part people are getting in and putting their own information on there wow that's nice i've liked that please thank you good thank you um and i do want you i hope that you can keep that um the document that i gave to you because it does have a list of several different types of you know i'm using google today because we only really have time for one um one thing but there are several different uh types of collaborative and interactive technologies that people have listed so i hope that you can go through that document that was shared before and you can look at the things that people shared some of them are very interesting a lot of people like mentimeter or mural or some of the um other questions that might be there there does not seem to be any other questions did you have did you say you go back the slides is something on the slides that you wanted to show yeah yeah i think you can do that and you can go back the slides will grab some seven minutes to the end of this perfect all right so i have seven more minutes keep asking questions if you'd like so i have other things that we could you know we don't have a lot of time to deal with it today um but there are other other types of um interactives that you can do through google or through other um types of things there are also other tools that are usable and i'll i'll make this into a presentation so it's a little bit bigger for you so tools can be like posting i really like to get tools where people can go on a board and post you saw some of those in that document that people shared with each other in your groups i use neuro but mural is another one so these types of things people can get on and post and we can play around with those types of things it's it's nice to be able to see what the students are thinking in different environments so it's kind of fun with that um oh it's not advancing for me just a second polling i always like to have some kind of good polling software um that gives me a lot of information about students in a very quick way um some polls like zoom polls if we're doing you know this experience of synchronous instruction i really like to have polling as a capability so i can see if students are following me i also use something called pull everywhere and if it's tied to my university that also gives me an idea of who is participating so if poll everywhere is integrated with my learning management system it can tell me that a certain number of people with their names it tells me who participated in the polling activity so i like that um i use other types of collaborative software for things that are more creative um i like the adobe products and perusal is one where people can interact around an article or something like that and i have a bunch of others um richard wanted me to share this list here it's it's actually let me hurry and grab the there we go i'll put this in the chat this is just a quick um look at so many tools that can be used and hopefully it translates well into french here is a list of hundreds of tools that people use and some of them are very good for interactions but these all support learning at some level so so this is you know it can be helpful just to look through the list and see some of the things that you really feel like you need in your class again i go through you know what's the most interactive for certain things let me hurry and answer some of the questions can you interact with google doc with someone who has no google account yes so google opens for people who don't have a google account as well so that's kind of a nice feature with google another question from alien so in between the three interactions that i'm discussing so with content with the instructor and with other students which one is for metacognition i say that any of them could be for metacognition it really depends on the prompt that you're giving for example um with the content if i want them to you know metacognitively think about the content i'll ask very specific prompts and questions such as why am i sharing this content with you what makes it important and how do you feel about this content do you understand it or do you not understand it so really it's more about the prompt with the interaction rather than when whether one type of tool fits metacognition better is more about the prompt if that makes sense other questions and feel free to put them in the chat or you can put them in uh you can raise your hand and talk if you'd like so um what i've learned from what you've said is that i can i can get many google tools when i use drive right is that that go to drive yes so the drive.google.com will give you access to all of the tools all right and one two three one thing i've learned is that if you if you can also go to youtube video and helps you to learn how to use some of these uh these tools yes yes any one of these tools so when you come here to new or nouveau in french you'll be able to use any of these tools so documents sheets and slides that's your presentations or there are even others like um there's a jam board is a bulletin board that's shareable with people i have an example of it today so if we wanted to come here this is a jam board where we could post things and you know you can do it in english and in french people can post they can put pictures things like that so it creates an interactive bulletin board for posting so that can be helpful as well questions oh is it so this is a great question thank you brian is it possible to cater for the visually impaired um your google products typically have like in your documents as long as you are using good um heading features for example here if i'm this is my blank document you really want to work on using your headings well because people with visual impairments need a screen reader to be able to read so these headings will lead the screen reader to go to the right sections for them so um and it's something probably to look up we you know we don't have time for a full accessibility discussion here right now but if you can use these headings the people with screen readers will be able to go to the right section based on what what the heading is telling them to do so it's more about the the creation of the product the product itself itself supports accessibility but the person who creates it needs to be aware of how to create that for people with visual impairments that's a great question other questions i think we have one more minute yeah let me ask one more question yes we okay which which uh from my experience which is the inductive tools have you used that to find it quite easy to use so that one can be one of these easiest ones um so google is fairly easy um but you do have to you want to practice with it first because the first time you teach with any new technology it's it's like anything that you're learning that's new you have to do it slowly so i would do something very simple first and practice first make sure you know how to share the links what will happen with students and how to you know kind of uh do some tech support things um polling i think pulling is probably the easiest thing to do um you know google so zoom has its own polls um but any kind of polling service that's where you you get quick information from your students it's easily digestible as a teacher to be able to see if students are understanding with polls but i really like polls zoom poles are okay i use pull everywhere it's a little bit limited in the free version so if you have large classes that some of the constraint is the free version only gives you i think up to 50 people um to be able to respond so that that can be a little bit of an issue but i really like to have polls i think that's the easiest one to use if i have to give a single answer okay thank you and alien asked so in the chat alien asks if these are secure if they're free and that is another great question another constraint that you might have most of them will come with security statements like what they do with it so you do want to read your security statements well one thing we have at our institutions is usually we have a group that will go through the licensing so if our institution purchases one of these technologies they'll go through the licensing and make sure that they're secure for students and student data is not being used elsewhere and that can be an issue i know you know some of our refugees have had issues with using whatsapp because they're afraid it's tied to kind of a facebook space and they're afraid it's being shared with google we have actually google that is tied to our institution so it's gone through the security protocols to make sure that they are um that they're they're good and they're they're usable but you do have to be careful because it is student data sometimes you have to be careful with what's being shared so that's a great question so thank you kim i think we have to close it here you can give one final statement you can make one final statement yes so we have i you know especially with that with that link and with other things hopefully they'll be able to share these slides with you because i do have some links on these slides um really it's just choosing one first don't get overwhelmed choose one simple one first start with that see how it works i like pulling personally um and then build up if you can i really like the collaborative nature of google documents but practice practice first with your friends a little bit if you can to make sure that it works so that you're more confident when you go into the actual instruction aspect of teaching with these interactives but interactions will increase the learning in such a great way i hope that you'll be comfortable and able to use them and thank you for letting me participate yeah thank you so much uh dr kim for that i know that we we shall really call you back sometime because i know you have as many as 100 tools and it was just the beginning of this uh yeah you've given us something like at least one thing you have to help teach us is that google has very many tools and african languages that have loved that about it and we have tried to interact we have further interaction maybe just in half a minute allow me to call upon desiree to comment as to whether to some extent we have answered his question a desiree can you just comment to what extent we have tried to answer the question thank you for associating me to this activity yes i got specific answers to this um to these tools and the interaction i'm going to try them out and i'm sure there are some networks which are free and we shall be working slowly anyway okay thank you so much desiree thank you so much uh kim for making this available i thank the audience for this please register in the link register because you are going to have a certificate at the end of this session so let me hand over christine christine back to you thank you thank you so so much ladies and gentlemen before i make final announcements i just want to re-echo that in case you want to claim a participant or participation certificate please click the link that has been shared it is in english but also in french and complete it it is it takes less than five minutes that data is very important for us to modify these sessions moving forward all right so uh ladies and gentlemen allow me to thank each one of you for actively participating during this interactive session it was really really interactive thank you but also allow me to thank dr kim and dr desire so so much for the job well done you have really engaged us we have learned quite a number of things thank you so much and just to reach what richard said i'm sure as we move along we may want to have you back because this is uh a topic that i'm sure we need but also we have not exhausted i also want to mention that there are a number of people that still had questions and comments feel free to share them here even if we don't answer them now we are going to answer them on

uh to try to be active in this and let us have a very good training here okay so before i i continue you need to know about this program replay how who has organized it uh who are the stakeholders involved and then we're also going to get to the facilitator as we have facilitators on board they are going to introduce themselves also briefly and then we shall be able to start immediately on our first topic of the day yeah so that is the what we are going to be having now we are going to be getting uh some of our other partners they will be joining us during others other phases and other sessions which will be going on okay so let me start by talking about the organization which has made this possible and this organization is known as edify uganda edify uganda it is a christian organization um which supports education it's an organization that supports education and supports schools specifically so that is edify uganda it is the organization that has organized and sponsored this particular training and so you the edifying gun has a website edify.org you can come and read them about them uh and what they do the core values uh the mission is to improve and expand christ sustainable christ-centered education globally and uh improve and expand improve and expand so when you talk about improvement expand what is there not to start something but to improve so they they they work with schools which are already there which are trying to provide an education to children and they support them so that they improve and expand so they get partners alongside local partners like for example here in uganda they are working with us as one of the partners they have many other partners in different things that they do they have a partner for training they have a partner for loans edify has partner for education other partners for education technology so so they work with these partners and then we work with identify works with the schools to make sure that they improve the quality of education expand their schools and build their longevity in their communities so that is the one of the things that is here so this bachelor training here we are doing it remotely because of kobe but before kobe we had several trainings that were taking place physically in schools and uh ict session we have a team of teachers who were going to those schools and they were supporting these schools so edify is in 11 countries 11 countries you can be able to know about uh edify and the countries where it is and um uganda is one of the latest countries actually if it's not the  so if you go here and you click on them we also have uganda uganda yeah so edify has is in 11 countries you shall be seeing the part of uganda there then we have um um why why the schools they work with low fee the schools should be low fee low fee so that they afford they will buy by by the by the children that 856 to impact yeah so uh so the schools that deliver education for less than a dollar a day those are the schools that edify really wants to support yeah so then he measure our impact so 85 is in over 8 000 schools now and uh so in any in addition to helping this could become sustainable if i helped it become christ-centered so eddy5 is a christian organization so they they do discipleship training for for staff discipleship training for children before there is like one of the partners they are having a scripture union a main event description uh description you need schools and its role yeah so that is the review that is the vision all students should be learning and flourishing so in a time when they have what called covet and the learners are at home it is really timely that we have interventions that can be able to support now we have what we call the the crisis the global education crisis and then we have what we call the recovery plan um so as we know uh many many of the children don't access education and uh this has been accelerated by what you call the uh covid covid19 yes so edify has a plan um for supporting the schools uh during this period the partner schools partner schools are christian founded schools or schools by christian owners who start schools so they apply and they become part of the christian schools that educate supporting yeah so this bachelor training actually is targeting mainly teachers from these schools who could be having some teachers as well come from other schools uh because any time they can still become staff of these schools but the main target was the schools the partner school teachers so in uganda um nearly 400 thousand children are not in school according to unesco and some of them attend upe schools but still even in the epa schools um  even in the up schools okay let me let me hope let me first share this very well let me first continue sharing okay let me continue sharing let me share the entire screen here okay so i was talking about that many of the children even in ub schools cannot read and write even their own names so that is a big challenge so 85 comes in we have the 78 percent literacy rate and 85 began here in 2019 that is only two years ago 2019 and 2019 so 85 has been doing training 3400 144 training school leaders have been trained and then teachers so it has been focusing a lot on school leaders administration so that the schools can be sustainable school leaders are trained on how to manage the schools uh so that they can continue so schools like this one here can be given loans to put up a classroom blog i think rogers has good issues members do you hear me yes

stress alright it's fine so mr emma root have you greeted the members yes  you finished it yes okay even with something under mr henry okay so we we have okay we have those yeah it's fine okay maybe let me talk about let me just talk about the training platforms that we are having briefly so we are having a number of platforms which we are going to be using for this training we are having a uh a local classroom this google classroom uh is what we are going to be using to uh to put the assignment and the we are going to train you on what you call google classroom uh later on but uh for now what we want to request you is to join the google classroom so we are having the uh what you call google classroom so what you are going to do is you are going to go to your if you have a computer infrastructure the computer you will go to  you will go and you you type google classroom on your gogo so  google classroom when you go go in you search on your on your internet in your browser you search for google classroom so when you search for google classroom it brings this you click on classroom is what classroom here now when you click on that it is going to bring um uh it's going to bring the classrooms that you are in so for me currently i'm having the several classes i am in but for you not see anything here you will just see a blank a blank uh you don't see any class here so what you will do you click on this there's a link up here a plus that you click on and on that class you click on joining class you click on joining class so when you click on join a class it will ask you to put in a class code so this class code you type in q you type in q  j o y q a seven okay so that is what you you type in and then when you type in there you click on join so it is it is going to ask you that's right you should make sure you type it correctly if you type it wrongly then it will it will not work well okay so you should be able to type in correctly so you type in q yeah you you type in correctly that that class code now for me i think because of being the the teacher in this google classroom it is not allowing but uh let me first open it is here this is the google classroom it is cue the passcode is qj you should write this this one somewhere you write this class code somewhere on user pen and write it somewhere on your paper q j or y q a seven so this is the this is the the class code that you need so you you should be able to type that so the instruction was simple let me just repeat it just once one more so you type gogo gogo.com let me switch the account to another let me switch to another account  okay so for you when you go to google.com maybe you will not be logged in so it will bring this so you you put in your email uh you put in your email so you you put your username like mine is my calendar gmail.com and then from there i put in my password as well and then i click on next so it is good to ask me to it is going to okay it's fine um i click on not now so it is going to sign me in so you should be logged in here your name your your name here it is going to bring your app so you can be able to you can be able to to do what to okay so yeah so uh i was saying here that you when you go to go go the first thing that i want us to know is we are having a digital classroom so i wanted us to learn how to join that classroom yeah so uh you the first thing you need to do is to login to your google account so you go to google you search for google and you log in if you are using a phone you are already logged in because most of the phones they are they require login to your phone with your email so you come here at the top you can even come at the top and you look for google classrooms one of the apps here or you search for it on google so you open google classroom so now here i'm doing it using a different phone so from there you click on this part and then you click on training class and then you put in the class code and then you click on chain the class code should be able to work okay so it has it has made me to enter so that's what you are going to be doing so this is where we are going to put the work and uh it is going to be marking we are going to be having the results here and everything is going to be at that point that is the first the first task that we are having that we are supposed to do to be in the training google classroom okay so that is the one thing that you need to do then the other thing is the there was some group uh we're having also our staff group uh if we are not in the whatsapp group we are going to open yourself group has been silent but we after this meeting today we are going to open it and we are going to be interacting yeah so ever since we created whatsapp group it has been silent uh but we are going to be uh opening it and then we shall be interacting uh the reason why we decided to be silent at the start is because we wanted to communicate the rules of the sub group whatsapp is something which is normally misused sometimes and people can join a group when they don't know the rules then they start posting things which are not related to the training or to the group policy so uh that's why we kept the group closed until when we have finished the orientation uh for us we can be able to know that now this is what we are going to be doing in this group so in the group we are going to be uh really focusing on issues to do with e-learning yeah so it is to do with e-learning and this particular program you ask about you know the technologies you ask a question you say i'm stuck here the facilitators are going to be on and they are going to be responding to any issues that are going to be coming up in the group yeah so that is one thing that you are going to be doing so i'm going to share the link to the group as well if you are if you are not um not in the group you should be able to to join the group and then communicate accordingly yeah so we are going to be sharing that uh that is that link in the in the chat yeah so it will be easy for you to just tap that link and then you you join the the group and then you can be part of the the training yeah so that is the is one other thing that we are supposed to do accordingly yeah so the training platforms and we have their sub group then finally we have the zoom and they are already away on the zoom so they they they were sub group link i've just shared it in the chat you should be able to see it if you are not in the whatsapp group you just tap on that link which is there in the chat and then you take a minute to join that particular group because we are going to be sending some other communication there it is going to be our support area for us to share yeah so one of the things we we need and as we use these tools we need to be learning how we are using it so we also expect you that in your school if you are considering to use something like whatsapp you should be able to know how to administer it know when to close it knowing to open it know how to change its settings so this is the group and i'm seeing a lot of members there have joined already uh this is known as cohort 25 elearning training and uh we are having the the the the training uh the group information is here there is uh the policy uh here the the group policy it there's a group of people there's a group policy here only a possibility to e-learning are allowed and when the group is closed you can contact anyone that means forehead so for now let me open the group um so i can allow send messages and i say all participants can now send messages because now they know uh what to do in the group yeah so in case you violate the group policy you don't blame anyone when you are removed from the group yeah because you'll be dividing us from the reason why the group was created yeah so whatsapp has to be identified like that even as a school whenever you created any whatsapp otherwise you'll be surprised by what people will post in the group and you you will regret why you even created the group so that is one thing that i i want the teachers to know and to be vigilant about so those are the two things whatsapp group for chatting and asking for support straight to the e-learning lego classroom is your place where you're going to be doing the assignments when we put the work it will be appearing here under class work and you'll be able to see the class work right now there is nothing but we are going to put some work immediately after this session yeah so basically those are the that is the to do with the introduction uh about 85 about to the christian school owners association uh about to ict teachers association those are the organizations you should know about and then about the google classroom and whatsapp group and also about the facilitators that are with you here and also maybe the other thing is about the schedule let me finalize with the schedule the schedule is already here on the website of the ict charts association uh we are going to be sharing the link again and they deteriorate but for today we are going to be looking at a creating slides creating slides that is one of the fastest things that a teacher does it is to teach you remotely you know how to create good slides not just creating slides but engaging slides slides which will impact and will help and facilitate the lesson and also creating videos we shall be looking at it later on then we have email and google drive tomorrow and google docs uh in the at four then on the next day we shall be looking at is zoom how do you set up zoom and administrate where what are they doing don'ts how do you make your zoom now like in today's meeting you can see it is ordering it is not having a lot of noise not everyone is speaking the way he wants we have muted you on purpose so because um if you're on a zoom and you don't do some of these things you can be it can be it can fail to work for you so that is one thing that you should be looking at you should also look at gogomit which is an alternative to zoom then we shall look at how to create a school youtube channel uh looking at what other schools are doing right now many schools are creating youtube channels why and how can you create one and also a school blog we shall look at examples of school blog or website how you can create one even yourself you can create it you should you don't think that it's very hard you can't do it then we shall be looking at that then we shall look at your classroom versus what's up avoid they've been telling you about our classroom and what's up and uh so we shall be comparing the two how do you use them what news and don'ts which settings do you do to make sure that it is effectively running well for you as a as a school or as a teacher finally we shall look at colibri calibri is a software for uh for creating a digital library when the question on another session whether they have colibri it is installed uh when you've got the website of christian school another session you'll find a pathway that is callibri so we shall be teaching you how do you create something like this and it can be accessed without internet we shall be telling you more details about how you can create colibri uh which is having a lot of educational materials uh that are available that you can be able to you can create a digital library for your children even even when at home uh you can be sending them tokens and they import materials uh for reading for all classes so we shall be telling you more about colibri as well uh during this particular training and how you can set up one for yourself finally on saturday shall give general elearning tips and strategies and then we shall conclude the training now you see we have compacted this training the first cohort they they took two weeks but for you you are doing it in one week and you're even doing the school blog which one never did so you are having more work in less time so i want you to tighten your belts and uh give this time don't just attend the zoom session and then you come back and attend the next one tomorrow without doing anything join this training because you want to get a particular skill and like we said uh we should only give certificates to people who will do all the assignments we don't want to certify here and say that you have learned how to create equilibrium library when you have not so make sure that you take time when you come for the one hour uh you one and a half hours you attend then some yeah you take another one off and then you do the work that i've been given okay now at this time i'm going to request um uh mr henry sachito i think mr dunbas is off mr henry said you're going to stand him you're going to stand in for him and you're going to be telling us about slides but before that maybe let me first get some questions as mr henry prepare to take us in the presentations let me get some questions from the members if you have any questions you use the you put up the hand using the there is a feature for putting up a hand you put at the hand you have a question i don't know whether the orientation the introduction has been comprehensive what the training is about what are people involved what is this schedule what i expected to do if you have any questions you can put up a hand i would also ask members you can also tell us your expectations if they are not being uh met you can tell us and we can see how we can do what we are just i've seen three hands and i think these are the three hands that are going to get a chance other members will give us maybe a feedback at the end so i'm going to let us listen from uh mrs muhumuza he says he says you can uh if you want you can turn on your video and we see as you speak that you can know uh we can be able to get here from you he says yes good morning to everyone morning my question is i just wanted to know uh decisions run from 10 to what time okay sessions are one and a half hours maximum it can be one hour and then the other one hour for questions and answers yeah because in the first phase we're using only one hour but we saw always we're going beyond so we shall be targeting at one hour but image go beyond by 30 minutes so one and a half hours so from 10 to 11 30. thank you

then you take over the session okay thank you rogers  yes hello yes we can hear you so can i start yes okay thank you good morning good morning colleagues my name is roomba stephen and i want to introduce ourselves to you uh how are you going to do this um our topic today among seve
al of these perspectives powerpoint basics of teachers i am jumba stephen and uh first uh about me i am a web designer and i take i teach my customer school he's on school of computing and then i repair computers i still my place well i also happen to be contracted by several schools among which are like i've been to trinity college  i've been to saint martins i haven't been across the country repairing computers in web design i have worked on several websites of schools uh the most current project of which projects we have three current projects integration of bingo champagne college school india current school uh central london ssna bingo and many others and then i'm a test pinot what i mean we have a web design business with the previous speaker mr rogers it's called these services i have entered an internet cafe with two branches one in a big another and in sanji and then how they and things like that if i come to vote for you why you are here today uh we want to use plan how to use powerpoint some of us already know how to use powerpoint but for the absolute beginners why why are we choosing to teach powerpoint first of all this presentation software gives you the ability to present your lesson in point form if your teaching might be about countries in east africa you'll come and list out your countries and so on and maybe some south sudan and then you'll talk a lot about those countries but on news live you'll just have the outline and then in your lesson purpose will help you or your students concentrate on the primary parts of the lesson let us look at a geography lesson there are the paragraphs continually five lines five lines of a paragraph explaining just one point so but in powerpoint what we do we just hint on the point and then the teacher does the explanations powerpoint also has animations which help engage or keep the learners hooked throughout the listeners a lesson can be boring when someone is simply looking and so with powerpoint the ability to put animations helps you perhaps the learners stay engaged as they look through the animations and transitions but in today's lesson it's going to be short of course it will not be as comprehensive as a real powerpoint resource possible but we are here to highlight and i expect that by the end of this session uh all of us here can launch a powerpoint presentation we can create slides we can add text and images you can work with transitions animation and then even finally you can present that's what i expect from each of you and in fact by the way to earn our certificate uh you must have must present you must have a presentation made by you we are not just here to to pass time and and uncertificates our certificates really have to show that you really learnt what is or what you are meant to learn but as you are dealing with powerpoints there are the words will come to here and they may be new to you i i'll highlight just four major words one of the words is a presentation when you hear someone talking of a presentation what are they what are they meaning a presentation is a series of slides a presentation is a series of slides with a text maybe you have a heading and then a line or two above that heading and then maybe a picture to illustrate what you meant and then a few animations are fun to eat after presentation we have you'll hear the word slides the lights slides slides and slides the presentation is made up of several slides those slides are similar pages for example pages in your presentation for example if we are talking about um maybe the history of yoga from independence up now and we were to highlight the presidents we've had since then one of the slides will have one president the time maybe he was with us he served uganda and then after the time when he stopped just just a few a few items about a particular president then on the next slide you'll have another president and so on so that is what we call a slide and then another word that you you you have to use or get used to is the word trance season now because the presentation is made up of lies when you're moving from one slide to another the effect that occurs between the two are between those two strikes is what we call a transition as you're transiting from one slide to the next like let me illustrate we are on this side just look at the previous slide you see that the slides are moving powerpoint has several several transitions to choose from so when i go to the next slide you see that next another slide is sliding and the other one disappears and now looking at the new slide so that's what we call a transition and then one of the other things we are going to use so much uh i mean we are going to use notice size so much animations an animation is a specific effect on a particular item for example if you have a picture maybe a picture a map of uganda how does it how does this draw a person's attention during the presentation it could check you have to get used to now but as you're making a presentation uh it is easy to make a presentation by the way in a few minutes you can have in just five minutes you can make a presentation but the question is was your presentation what makes a good presentation your presentation is supposed to be short and then use appropriate fonts uh don't worry i will list this in i'll share this in the group and then you will also use proper contrast then there are you have things like data for example you're talking about the population of different countries on the continent in africa the african continent how do you visualize this data do you see report figures uganda's population is 40 million that of kenya is 57 billion and that was sort of guys it doesn't add appeal to your presentation so sometimes you could visualize it i illustrate it uh as we as we make our first presentation and then much as transitions add good effects to your presentation overusing them where is not good and that won't make a good presentation so our first presentation here perhaps let me first ask and we have by show of hands by show of hands who oversee is using uh whoever is using a laptop do you have anyone here using a laptop are we all using phones we are 49 of us and all of us is this am i the only one using a laptop whoever is stephen crispins italy bel cardo someone with the galaxy s8 plus your footer oh yeah i have this here i have george so so let me please let me engage you all of this would you please join me and talk to us hello yes good morning please this morning or saturday morning good morning to you okay are you using a laptop yes i am okay now i'm going to request that that uh i don't know could you share your screen are you are you able to share your screen with us so that you illustrate to us how we are going to go how we are going to launch our past presentation is it possible don't worry don't worry i'm not ready because uh my screen has this screen on it oh no we can change that okay so i just i just share my screen yeah first what we need first yes is the ability what we need is is your ability if you're ready yes i think you can take me through okay you know what we are going to learn this as well as yes we must be able to launch the application okay then we should be able to save this presentation we should be able to add and populate slides okay then a few animations and transitions okay and then also present is that fine with you um i can try yeah i will be talking youth brothers don't worry okay no problem okay then so i'll stop my share and then we are going to make our presentation so peace yes please  thank you so much peace yes i'm going to i'm going to oh okay peace yes please at the bottom of your screen yes is a wide search the web and windows you see that yes i see it yes so you're going to type powerpoint okay power power point is one one okay so it comes at the top so you're yes i've clicked now here should i close this yeah you close that okay and then do you see the word blank presentation yes i see it so you're going to click blank presentation okay and here we are we have we have we are we are able to launch our point ah okay yes yeah we are comfortable uh yeah thank you and then what notice there is a fight at towards the top on the left you see that point box yes i see it that is what we call a slide yes a powerpoint presentation multiple slides yes let me just illustrate you're going to illustrate for us how to create another slide let us let us assume we are going to create five slides okay i want you on your keyboard to hold down ctrl plus the letter m control m yes m for mother okay control and let me just do something i can't see clearly okay control m okay yes control last name okay so we now have if you'll notice we have slides one two three four five yes but these slides don't have any information on them yes now let us also assume that you created these slides by accident you didn't intend to uh you're going to right click on slide 2 slide 2 right right click ok here and then choose idiot slides okay so i want you to delete the slide two three and four so that we have only one slide okay yeah we lost you we lost you i'm here oh you don't have me should i share again yeah please share your screen where am i oh i have to go back to zoom yes you go back to the zone yes screen at the bottom yeah okay yeah now we have a presentation with just one it's like one one slide right yes yeah one of the for earlier versions of windows yeah i'm sorry of office oh are there versions of powerpoint yes it is a good habit to keep serving our work as yes okay so how are we going to how are we going to save our work you're going at the bottom at the bottom left i'm sorry at the top left of your of your presentation is the word file so i'm going to tap file and tap on fire yes fire there we are so this brings you the backstage view that is what you call the backstage save as yes yes save us okay yes okay guys there we are yes now we are going to pretend you are you are the country director let us assume the country director of eddy5 okay and you have to create a presentation for maybe two officials of the ministry of education okay so let us click uh in the underworld you see the word this edify uganda edit file uganda okay thank you and then you start okay so our presentation now has a name if you notice up there in the middle in the top of your screen you have the name edifier your panda powerpoint you see that uh where exactly at the top yes of your screen don't worry move move to the right this side move to the right this way yes okay now in the middle in the middle of the spring up are you seeing it yes i am okay do you see the word uh okay no worry no worries still for us we are seeing eddie fire uganda so that is our first okay our past is presentation and slide however let us first look what are the colors of edify you don't just create a presentation well i hope people know what bar means for lack of a better one now if edify their color is blue you may want your presentation also to have the theme color blue isn't it okay yes that's true yeah now let us first choose a design this design here that we have is is dual and remember the purpose of writing presentation is to to keep people engaged so when you start exploring your people will sleep during the presentation now let us choose a design and how are you going to do that you remember where the word file is yes next to the word file what word you see no don't click file above above home and then next insert and then next design now you're going to you're going to tap design okay yeah we have a variety of designs you see those designs those things with the with the capital a and the small air yes so those are the designs we're going to choose from yes i want to give you a chance to choose a design which one would you choose did you say we need to use blue okay this is too much blue i don't know no worry okay don't worry we can't go with that okay now at the bottom you find the word click to advertise then you're going to type the word edify gosh edify uganda yes please yes and then where you say click to add subtitle perhaps you can put your name okay  yeah yeah so thank you now first let us think about what are we going to talk about edified uganda in our presentation one of the things we can talk about at the fire ghana is the mission okay and then maybe we shall talk about the statement of faith where else where else in the world is edify phone then as edify what should we do where is our office what is the team i mean how is our team what who is on our team and maybe the impact just a few a few slides okay are you finding this yes yes please can we go ahead yes please okay now i want you to go back uh this is the one insert on our uh on our menu yes i see it it's here click insert okay insert and then we want to add a new slide it's the very first button okay so we want to want to put our we want to put maybe our mission until yeah let us use the second let's achieve this this one is that you this one yes no problem okay and then we shall click and then why is it click to add title yes we are going to put type a defines mission okay  and then uh down where simply to edit it yes let us type let us type uh to improve to improve and expand sustainable to improve and expand sustainable christ-centered education christ centered education globally globally globally sorry it's not properly it's globally globally okay  thank you now this is a presentation and one of the qualities of a good presentation is having the effects legible enough  big enough for a person to read from a distance but again not to be so what we are going to do we are going to select that text if you need help select fine now let us go to the home button font yes okay i wanted us to use the home button or the home button home okay here and then just after 22 there is a letter a uh-huh i want you to continue until you feel that's you enough me to do what click click on this one what three times yes please oh okay i've clicked three times yeah we are now using our eyes to see whether this is fine perhaps that is okay okay so we put to improve and expand so that is our nation right yes is that okay yes please and then uh let us choose the word edify identifies nation edifice i wanted to choose it to select it highlight let us then let us use font color you see that there is a letter a with a red underline just on the side there is a drop down arrow oh yeah yes okay and then choose a blue adduction of blue this one is that okay yeah where is that okay should we increase the size of the letters okay we can also try that out because this is a topic uh-huh yeah let's click just one more time do this that's enough no no don't over don't take it so much just you okay is that fine sure i think so okay now we have we have our heading here as tedious mission and now we are concentrating on to improve and expand sustainable price education globally so as a presenter you will talk about this mission because you are edified you understand everything but you are giving the people you're presenting the opportunity to concentrate on the mission itself that is the mission and then your explanation comes with your words is that okay yes please so now from there let us see what is their statement of thing now you can either go to insert and then is it inside this slide we have that option but don't choose that for now yeah that is optional one the other option we have is you can right click on on slides tool okay right flick and then duplicate duplicate no no no no no i duplicate oh right click and do this so you're going to right click i duplicate yes when you duplicate it sends you the hassle of changing font size it gives me the one it serves you the hassle of dealing with bonds okay statement so you already have your your statement in the color that you chose and the size that you chose right is that okay piece yes this um okay we believe and then you open quotes i do what open quotes  the time has come  the time has come  yes yeah there is something that is something that i wanted you to ask her to do you see sometimes when we are creating these slides as teachers uh we can copy the words from text books from other sources we had the copies papers and we digitize and make them now digital format or we could get some information from the internet now now since her computer is connected to the internet i wanted her to just copy that sentence because it is there on the website so that she demonstrates that skill of copy and paste coping getting new things from the internet and putting on your presentation i i i don't know that you can follow face yes please will that be is there for you like to go to the uh okay it's fine so i have to to to minimize this one yeah right and then okay  so we are looking and about us you going about us statements don't click on about us just go and point on it then the drop down comes and then you oh yeah yes just up yes there is a drop down so scroll down so you just copy that sentence the first just this one the first one let us go to all right click ok now let's go to our presentation letter key on the other down go to the bottom here now towards the right there is a letter p in my screen you are seeing it on my own the red button the red icon afterwards okay this is the word search the web and windows yes i see it the fifth the fifth pattern okay i've seen it okay okay so i paste it here so if i first highlight that right click right click okay and then i then choose the letter a using later add under paste options no no no the next the last that one listen okay yes this will maintain our format okay time has come jesus said and so on and so forth okay so the statement of faith is longer yes but for this it feels like a class let's ask us to use that right okay sure yeah yeah now first we want to talk about where else every fight is found in the world okay so i do a new slide you can go to new slide and we have 11 we have 11 countries we have 11 countries which one would you choose here the new slide where do i find uh-huh no no there are there are many new slides i then move just two steps down oh okay i remember i remembered you wanted to duplicate yes okay that's fine also i say where else do you find edify you can type edify worldwide edify worldwide  then go to the home button i go to the home button here yes and then you see the bullet just under the one with you under the word what review review where the s6 all right the seventh button the seventh button on the menu oh there is this thing of zomeot whatever how do i mean let me see if i can do this oops so you see the word review now let me see yes i see review now below there are those buttons when you tap on the drop down arrow you'll get a variety of styles of buttons okay which one would you choose maybe this one and then we can we are going to put just maybe three countries okay  enter don't worry about the spirits right now oh hi okay  ethiopia  okay so we have a list of 11 countries so if we have time we'll list all of them okay now right here now let us go back and duplicate slideshow okay right click and then you click it  then instead of edifying worldwide you can type what we do okay what we do  okay so maybe you can put edited head tech training for teachers oops oh they're too small aha now that was the mistake we did so let us delete slide two no slide five let us delete it okay let us duplicates right before what i would do i would pick at the end of the word okay can i first redo this yes what we do okay oh i just this is in our password okay but we maintain our phone and then record edited training for teachers okay thank you then affordable affordable loans for schools  which preaching the gospel  okay cool now we can duplicate that's true let us duplicate this right duplicate yes our team instead of what we do we are going to type our team okay  so let's go down so we are going to put gold fred gold over director  yes sir yeah there is also another skill i want to do so uh how to use how do you get a picture from the internet and put it in your slides we are going to do that okay then let us put um mario or officer  yeah and then let us put uh  transformation of visa christian transformation officer so you're going to duplicate that shoe the slide yes you pick up that slide

government of Cameroon to introduce what it called what is called electronic learning so that the children should be how can it be effective I told Ellen that we were joining Professor victim by Rika who is on a line to United States of America for this lecture to talk to us about how this electronic learning can be done using the experience the example from the ICD in versity USA Cameroon promised over to you yes we'll be prepared for such situations the ICT university offers on-campus courses to all our students for a la in a large part are on campus however they have the option of also taking our courses online this has tremendously help us to continue classes as if nothing ever stopped basically the question is what happens now to the teachers and students in these universities in this countries that have decided to close down many students will not be going to school anymore in fact some of even taking steps to use technology such as whatsapp Facebook etc to deliver classes but that is not good enough these technologies the ICT university is using in e-learning has been existing because of lack of trained teachers trained professors to use elearning platforms many African universities will be suffering for these school closures we have invested hundreds of thousands of dollars at the ICT University to build a strong elearning platform and strong elibrary platform what is this all about eLearning is simply where electric and teach these are courses from anywhere where they have internet access today the beauty is that much of Africa and the developing world we have some level of connectivity that can enable us access classes online however many universities have not taken advantage of these technologies existing in Africa today all we do most times is complain that Africa lacks Africa lacks Africa lacks the truth is even the basic data an individual in most African countries can buy to access the Internet is good enough if they buy these from telephone companies mobile phone companies such as F empty an orange etc these connectivity issues are there there are some challenges that they are workable for what we have existing today so we should not use Internet penetration anymore as an excuse also many institutions and governments have not trained there are professors there are high school teachers there are secondary school teachers how to become technology specialists learning technology specialists now this is something that we have been doing for many many developing countries donating elearning and a library facilities to many many universities in the developing world that are now taking advantage of these technologies to continue classes even with the existence of this coronavirus so now our lecturers are ICT University are teaching their classes online the students through their mobile phones have access to the libraries where they can download books articles etc to still continue their classes life and the model we use an ICT University is absolutely a hundred percent synchronous not asynchronous as many many universities decide to do to do but secret I mean the lecturer and the students can interact in real time the student can stop the lecturer in the middle and ask questions that's the beauty of e-learning yes we do own campuses in different countries yes we do own buildings but again in situations like this we cannot keep allowing students to come to these buildings which could lead to groin of this coronavirus infections so now these students sit in their bedrooms unable to continue their classes and we are very proud of what is happening at the ICT university today because of that so how does it happen when a student applies on joining the ICT University we give them an email a University email address with that address they are given a login to our e-learning system which they can use from anywhere in the world to access their courses online this is what has enabled AXA to University in Cameroon for example to be able to have students studying at our camera campus all the way from the United States from UK from different parts of Europe and different parts of the world in fact in our previous graduation students are flown into Cameroon to graduate from as far as the United States on Europe this has been one of the dreams of her as a technology enthusiast for Africa my dream has always been to see that one day not only African students who leave Africa to the rest of the world to go and study the students from the Western world from the United States from Europe etc can take courses in Africa through the power of eLearning we continue to support many institutions in Africa and we are proud of those institutions would partner Wow very interesting we will not start on professor America there who is live from the Reta States of America now gentlemen we just got what should be done now we've got the definition of what elearning is you sit in your bedroom you communicate with a teacher whatever is teaching and you can interrupt the teacher to execution now you are the expert you how possible is that yeah it is possible you know are the ice to university we have what we call on a hybrid system of learning where we integrate board our on-site students and the online students to get on the same platform to flow your lectures simultaneously so with our system the teacher why teaching on site in class teach via a platform which students do have account so students that are in their homes can connect to this account that is what technologies we have put him in that is like a video you see no it's not a video it's a it happened just like we are on this to do now and people are viewing us from from from home but our own is he works in Sochi with artists electrolyze in class teaching on Sci students some students are online at the same time following the same class and the students online can ask questions the teacher and the teacher banks us those on site listen to the Christian based online strange to us and the student on site also a few questions and it pull online to follow so it's a platform that matches but they all lines to them and the on-site student professor Victor yes you learned it or something yeah and irrespective of the country that you are you can follow the adolescents sometimes when I'm teaching PhD called Casas my student you ganda Nigeria Zambia as us they follow you understand so it is say actually explain you know and if you're not registered now university you you kinda had this access go once you come you are admitted you register you pay your fees then you have the access he actually gives them training you're not science they gives the training to the students how to you know login and then also to the lecturers how to login and also you know use even videos so that your students can you know upload and you I was really what time is that your read Katya Crassus so that it does anything some students who missed out they can't go back to what as we record it and then they follow up and so on this day we thought may be administrated policy theory and practice and which a Spanish ship Therese and then you now go back and read you know review your notes and then you ask questions at any time so even if you are at work like most of our students who I work as the managers you do your work and then 4 p.m. you log in in your office and to follow your courses you know you ask your questions you do your assignment and you present within litora you know the great understanding back to you so it's there's no pumps we are further sorry that miss coronavirus has really attacked the country and some of our students are really suffering but we thought it is really really good you know for also come and present our students would not lose anything our lecturers they're at home so you are free from the coronavirus but you still have your knowledge as if we are you know but I want to come back to you Smith Connie what are the requirements what are the things you need to be able to set up this online lecture yes before you know the requirements are two weeks you nobody institution and the students so for the student spend it's a laptop or a smartphone or a tablet or any wireless device the gadget you need internet connectivity and you need electricity so I thinks that I need it for a class so as a student really startling investi you need for that to have a restriction you need to have enrolled in the university program investi just gives you access to this platform yes where you could follow your classes online in real time life is like live sessions that is what the students need yes not you did invest what is needed a level of university invested yeah a lot of technologies that are and if a structure that is put in place you know you have the platform's you have these soft ways you have a combination of the libraries break it down for those people listening who don't have to be able race you have a platform you have the labor it's not yes I'm talking about the components that we used to be all that is build our online system so we have computers servers that we've installed this learning management system into apart from that we have other things that are attached to it to facilitate the online teaching because we are talking about showing where you were talking broadcasts in life to students all over the world at the same time as you're teaching from from Cameroon Nigeria and Uganda from booyah really not only internally not only externally so in booyah voila at the same time all this at the same time so and you must be able to manage all these students you know you are grading the evaluations the assessments there are tendons and all of these how do you know how do you know from from you only that students are present okay it was like this so once you a student I'm locking you log in with your name because the credentials if school gives you your login details which are unique to every student's so when I smell awesome typical yes yes dating the traditional learning environment supposedly the sound that was our students who are in classroom but there are also some who are fully up lectures from other countries and love our institution there so you are trying to explain how it is done how do you verify that students are actually following a lecture so once you log in once the students I'm seeing named Andy for jd4 Schmidt that should be you are you lecturing from commander following up as well yes yes does it so students can have students fully make lectures from Zimbabwe from Uganda fully lectures that I've been to I seen basic Cameroon are you can detect what happens is that they have login details that are given to them by the institution so while they login your names appeared a platform because the platform manages the attendance it manages even the slide because we teach via PowerPoint when presentations so when they login your names appear is a column where it attendance appear and it's a column where the teachers not presentations do when a child who is students in Uganda wants to exit question extremum and i want to ask a question to usually I won't be how do you know once you're on that platform there's an indication where you see raise your hand icon raise your hand you click on this icon indicating teachers on the teacher screen blinking so now you see I can identify this name by name by face by picture yeah you can call the phone Oh chinga one of my sayings in bad boy yes yes what do you want to see yes the hero mute yourself he speaks yes yes and it's checking out respond and if you have a question oh it's not clarified they can follow up questions and you reply the same way potty chat if you have some question are you type I want to type everybody sees so Chris and I have typed you know for whatever anger for which our country that oh please I don't understand this can you come again then everybody was here and you can respond important man and you've been heading university universities here and you presume this is very much to the Minister of Higher Education professor Minister simulation project from you knew who or saying that they are now adopting this do you think universities in Cameroon investor boy inverse of Marwa University own boundary the only one you only tube Amanda and the rest they have those facilities to be able to teach children today online let me not speak for other universities but I know that to be able to teach students on-site and online as pro so murrica was speaking and teaching us Oliver listen you need the equipment first of all and the subway that carries that possibility of teaching and you have need to have a good server with a nice volume that's this pays to be able to take two or three or four or five thousand students so you clip platform and pick up two thousand it takes thousands of students so if you you have that device the next step you have to do is to train the teachers who have to use that device you train them on how to use a device and you also train the students how to use the same device so the training is both on the teachers and on the students once you have trained them you can then use that device in kitchen and the teaching is a live teacher not is not just a vehicle sitting they are teaching as you are asking how do you know that the stress of attending every lecture on what a student signs in on to the program the name appears and the teacher takes attendance because if that is not done then some dare someone to say where are telling the classes when in about ten the classics we must have attendance taken and the software allows the attend a second you saw the the video that was that was sure there would be without the audio you saw we are a lecturer there from Uganda who are standing there he is in Cameroon teaching they were teaching students why Uganda and they are asking questions lifetime questions at the same time we have students in Nigeria we have students at Zimbabwe we have students in the United States we have student even in some Asian countries like in India and all of these students are connected to the platform when this Coronel Varro started and the Prime Minister put up a letter or a communique asking the school D'Cruz that wasn't a 7/10 of an of much the very first thing for me to do as the Vice Chancellor the university was to call an emergency meeting of all the administrator of the university we converge on the 88 in the morning we fell upon an administrative me making sure that every person was up-to-date with the teacher methodology of online classes we did that first of all secondly we had a meeting up with the students to find out from the sunna on the campus whether any of them had any difficulties to use the online and we charge our technology officer to help those students who were know very verse but the canoes were just came newly whenever adverse we'll have to use a system and that was done I will ask them in compliance with what you come with you they require some us you have to disperse not and go home and follow your closet from whom and what we do as a miniatures and ministry is to monitor to the same device the kitchen so we know from the our offices who is teaching I was not teaching the timetable is there will know this professor is not at this time to this time we monitor we monitor also the students who attended the class to make sure that administrative leave will know that work is being done we monitor when a client's and when the class begins and I'm many students attending each of the classes so if our common universities would like to use the same system our city university has the possibility and the means and expertise to train administrators of universities to train the lecturers and to train students on how to use that a nothing as for some Baraka Bradley said he's an expert in that domain he'll be very willing to send or the Espace together with him to do the training here in Cameron does advantage we'll have our students are all in their homes but they are no loose in every in a minute of their class now we have about 12 minutes to be together yes it's very interesting until we are not even realizing that their time is flying but how do you control the quad when you're writing exams for instance if somebody just when someone copied the assignment and gave or when you're when you're sitting exam how do you honor it [Music] we have first of all what we call our exams I've been what we call audited I mean I've been audited by the department heads to see that it meets the requirements for online examinations we also have put in place what we call a plagiarism software to check if the work was we copied somebody's work that was copied from somewhere how does it by the demo software function so it's it's software that stands once actually a student submits he saw her walk for evaluation it's always scans to see if these two then copies from somewhere he actually gives you the site where the various sites where the student copied information CODIS formation from yes so eventually it must be referencing consent so how do you copy work doesn't only mean going to copy from from electronic devices you could also ask a neighbor to help you yes you know online exams are its own format which is a little different from the normal examinations we have in Cameroon way yeah students have to be in a confined place being originated the exams that are considered to be open to exams and those results are set for example project B's give you a project that you work on this topic yes and you go do research you have a whole library in front of you you have to go do research internet reading books and things like that and come up with material and submit it is about mahjongg how do you control that besides if a tourism software you have to make sure this student don't go somewhere else to get material come and write exams and pass I said earlier they said the exam understand it to you you know it is very easy no for the lecturer to go through you could do Google Network and they will see that you have copies from you know some way without being is there any indication on your script that you crop it yeah constitute the attention Okoye attention on that do you have copies let me say this about online is emissions the questions are not given ahead of time there are live questions we know that just like you have in a traditional classroom setting once we assumed we were going to study them at 3 o clock at 3 o clock you lock in the attendance is taken there you are locked in and then as you started right on that platform we have somebody submit immediately at the same three hours after exactly immediately at that time as you submit the network and the sober knocks you out not so completely locked out Negreanu correct but you cannot go back to court because you have to be very apt it locks you out are you out of it kind of command is submitted and we receive it yes now when we receive it as Shiva Trilogy office I was saying we now have to subject that work again to the plagiarism test yes to see because it went somebody copies the copy answer from somewhere yes to bring a copy down the papers now when we subject that thing to appraisal ism test it will indicate to us that this sentence came from Mookie in his book that I to dispatch this will get it because now a library on the campus will have 80,000 books which have been downloaded into a seven place at a disposal of our students on campus I don't need intended to consult those ones once we have registered student and you already have a number and the password you can assess that library with the 80,000 books even with that if you copied something from there I reproduce it the preserving test was sure that there was plagiarized sentence and it came from this book on this page which was published in this year and at this time which someday we're going to take a a little break welcome back we are seeing what you can did you have African governments if the I in need of this of this type of technology which from all indications is very nearly nice economically friendly very excellent it stops the the temptation of traveling to school everyday which we already see involved it also stops the amount parents have to pay for it transport now I want to get a message from dr. everything good I mean it's excellent e-learning as if there no no there is nothing without a challenge as the new geophys das said the first challenge is people having internet do they'll have their laptops they don't have their place their smartphones and what a night if you don't have that becomes a problem and the challenge would have electricity and in camera we have that challenge in Cameroon they are too often we don't have electricity but for acida University for our students we also have that challenge when they cut off lighting on them we also have sulfide but we now have our own device a standby generator so as soon as we have of the three of them as soon as lights go off a modulator picks up Sarah we don't use up our classes maybe about 2 or 3 minutes that's a challenge in yourself and so the challenge for African governments is to make sure that we have electricity were able to make the possibility of our students who have the D tablets or in the internal Internet connectivity but we cannot use that challenge as something that will not be able to endure also become that these challenges are then better come to overcome before we come to you professor Elizabeth Tom and John be technical expert what are the challenges the Vice Chancellors has mentioned already number of challenges another challenge that also exists is the level of training these two days need to be trained no they are not very it's something that is very new they need to be trained it also requires a lot of discipline taking an online lesson requires a significant amount of discipline self discipline of the student now what are the main challenges we've they're gonna be highlighted so far they said by my talk colleagues you know this therapy it's a internet connectivity you know sometimes there's no internet but we make sure we offer backup we have three service providers you know that make sure they're always on standby you know you have you know all right yeah well we so that they are always there and she make sure that you know because we cannot afford with online training you must make sure that all the time all these are available to backup you said at home now just move our face are the community versus Africa universities suddenly enough now to embrace this e-learning well we I'm sorry to say that we do not yet have many universities that have this device where the possibilities are there we are ready and your name I will have that possibility we have the expertise to train other people to make our platform available to them and we are very open and if people want to be trained they don't have it we are open for them to come and we'll train them and they can have Lucy because there is no use for children to stay at home without doing anything it can stay home but as you keep studying without losing anything at all and that's what we are doing to our acid students who are home we are following our classes and we wish that all dive investors to follow suit by buying this equipment and by receiving the training both administrators and for students and lecturers so that they can quantitate without losing anything academic here because it will have a population that need educated that in the sub is another problem and I think presume vertical victor will stop the United States as an expert has a possibility of helping universities new camera and Africa by bringing s parts and with a Subway's registry for this online teaching for us to cut it out I must want to thank you very much for inviting us if you need any or that advice from other and this domain soon will you have the possibility and the capability with very willing to come and thank you personal BOTS professor Elizabeth Taman Jurong and mr. Schmidt honey where was thank you for coming thank you so very much commonalties one also the tongue prefers a victim body care all the way from United States of America who made this program to happen by accepting that you come and share the experiences of your institution
 the coronavirus pandemic has reshaped every aspect of how our world operates this obviously also include education following the adoptions of this measure schools be suspended until further notice well i don't think i have learned anything data bundles the buying of it it's very expensive when coronavera's lockdown comes my notebook is at school so i forgot the formulas the pandemic has come to kick us awake and to increase our speed of attending to the issues of connectivity in this documentary we explore the realities of e-learning during the ongoing state of emergency and analyze strategies geared towards a prosperous and industrialized namibia as per the objectives of vision 2013 since independent namibia has been investing between 20 to 25 of its budget in education though notable improvements have been made in areas leading towards the obtainment of solid education unsurmountable challenges still persist around access to education and the quality thereof in many parts of the country now with the covered 19 pandemic ravaging the world the challenges seem to have multiplied my parents cannot afford afford the e-learning equipment they would maybe just put in newspaper in the newspaper so that you can afford newspapers and the newspapers are also a lot costing a lot 5 dollars a lot working tirelessly to ease the burden on teachers learners and communities the executive directors in government institutes and heads of u.n agencies have become busier than ever they are pushing towards online education in namibian schools as a solution to disrupted face-to-face learning an e-learning system is one element of an education system right so it's not it cannot just stand by itself but it has to be built in as as full and part of of a whole system electronic learning or e-learning as it is also known has not been broadly integrated in the teaching and learning systems of many schools and universities in namibia yet but the government expressed in its national long-term goals that e-learning is a fundamental area for development during the covert 19 outbreak which resulted in a global shutdown of industries many universities and schools themselves emerged as champions and advocates of online education the e-learning initiatives they were basically born within schools out of their own initiatives e-learning took place um there are those you know young dynamic innovative teachers who said no we can do it and they embrace the opportunity why they have been testing and experimenting beforehand already with platforms such as google classroom and microsoft teams they then through this you know circumstances that were uncalled at that time unexpected they then expanded their expertise and of course it was more like a trial and error renowned secondary schools like delta namibia's capital city were the first to get active  natasha ulrich a life skills teacher here is one of those who introduced e-learning tools to enable continued education in events where face-to-face studying is interrupted one of our teachers decided that we need to be proactive so we basically got a team of four people together that via skype started making plans of how are we going to deal what are we going to use if they do make e-learning compulsory because obviously we didn't know where this was going and we didn't want to just leave our learners behind so that task team had four teachers and we were in constant communication with the principal and we looked at the different options that were available you know microsoft 365 moodle google classroom and similar learning management systems to utilize during that time obviously cost was a problem so if you're in namibia and you very quickly have to organize something you don't necessarily have the funds for it so we started experimenting with google classroom and when we got together for the first time as a as a school for meetings we did actually show the teachers how it works we introduced them to the concept and even the old teachers very quickly got used to how it works and that was actually quite good so um what you usually do when you want to navigate to google classroom is you type in into your search bar and it will show you the results we chose google classroom um in the beginning because it was very easy to navigate it has limited amounts of functions that you can do from the front end side you know from some of the user side and that means you don't get confused you don't have to look for things and because of that we chose this because we do have some teachers who are a bit afraid of actually using technology they they are not comfortable with newer technologies and they just they're scared of doing something wrong and in our case it was very easy to introduce we had a meeting where we set up a screen and they could see what we're doing we showed them what the buttons do and that was really easy for most of the teachers to use now in this case i'm already logged in so it pops up like that but here would be an account um verification so it says verify that this is you make sure that you are on the right email address and then it would take you to a section where you type in your password this is a password that you set up yourself okay now if if you are in your classes as a teacher you can name your classrooms in different manners now we usually divide them into their normal grades like abcd just because it makes it easier to manage smaller groups now as you can see our penetration is actually quite good we tend to have 36 to 37 students in a class and you can see that our learners are actually quite involved in their classrooms now these are all the classes that you as a teacher would have set up  the biggest problem we had was connectivity for learners when they were on the farm in the village or outside of the big towns so some of the learners had to actually travel from the village to the town to get internet that was a bit of a challenge other people use data and fortunately classroom doesn't use that much data if you do not work with videos too much so if you upload exercises and is that worked all right some of the learners were approached through whatsapp the parents were informed through whatsapp and some of the teachers also then wrote sms's and made phone calls now out of all of our learners i would estimate that about at least 75 to 80 percent did end up having access they they made a plan somehow and the rest of them we put learning packages together once a week that they could pick up and then we would just inform them via sms what to do with them yeah you guys are amazing my name is shiragaya 17 years old at delta secondary school i'm grade 12. um google classroom has really been efficient for us because we've been able to do more schoolwork and like just keep the morale for school there during this old lockdown for me it's been very helpful the advent advantages of google classroom is that we can do it in our own time and pace and we don't really have to wake up very early and be very tired and stuff like when i was trying to load my german oral email on it it was like saying try again and try again maybe they could make some modifications and other than that i really have no complaints it's an opportunity for us to learn even now that we're at school it's just to get more work and to get and also the one advantage also would be that if you missed a class or if you missed something then you can also access the information like you do not be like you must and then you have to catch you have to find ways to catch up you can actually go to google classrooms and access that information and get the correct answers for activities and stuff like that in the havana informal settlement north west of venturk we meet dilemeke and ravisa two best friends who attend junior secondary school in katatura  [Applause]  is line online program i usually go to my friends and ask the information and and i used to contact with my classmates to ask either they are going to get their paper or they are doing online usually i got i got an information that people are going to get better from school from school and the day that i went i didn't find teachers i used i i went back home next friday i went to school and i got my papers so it seems for me difficult because some things we didn't do it my name is maria migonda i'm elena at imanoshi fiti in creighton due to this corona i was a little bit wandering which i'm no more going to school i'm going to repeat gradient next year but when it comes in the middle my teacher plans to tell us we must try to use e-learning then i don't have a smartphone i asked my mom to help me their smartphone and every week she struggles to buy a time for for her to do for me away my mom is no more going at work she was she was retrenched due to corona because she was the only parent that can help me my my father is a domestic work she he only goes at work three times a week so now it's difficult for me to find for my dad to buy for me a smartphone we don't have electricity in our house because he have to buy food do this because he's the only one to find money in the house my mom is no more going at work  we are also aware of that the access to e-learning is not at there for every learner that means it's only a currently a small group of learners who benefit from that um model so what as a as the ministry we advocate is that beside the initiative of e-learning schools and teachers still have to prepare learning packages and that is as they have started to resume duty teachers were engaged developing learning packages and our minister has been visiting schools and has witnessed that teachers do develop and has praised teachers and we do reach out and acknowledge that commitment of teachers to develop material so once material is developed of course it can be put online and in this initiative of supporting our learners under adverse circumstances which could be locked down or you know that face-to-face teaching and learning is interrupted again we have together with namco the namibia college of open learning which primarily has its mandate for the recent candidates the those learners who have not achieved in their first attempt it used to be that catch-up mechanisms for them but as they have been producing online resource material and have that interactive platform already called notes master we have been teaming up with namco to strengthen that delivery mode and within that process more than 200 teachers have been recruited volunteered to develop learning content so we will have to make that more accessible and  yes whereas it is right now not a policy position that every learner must have as access to a smartphone or a tablet or an ipad or or a laptop that is not yet a policy position because yes we have limited financial resources and the for example what would fall into this bracket is the textbook budget is the textbook or the learning support materials which would be a laptop a kindle ipad or a smartphone could fall into that category but we asked yet to revise our policies acknowledging these challenges it is important to note that namibia was once a leader in ict development in africa but the country's ranking dropped due to among others seemingly inactive policies concerning access for all and affordability as well as a lack of human resources  namibia has invested a lot from the marine cables bringing connecting namibia to the to the to the large i would say uh i.t infrastructure or internet infrastructure from the expansion of of the um the the the connectivity here in namibia these these are investments that are made that should support but in addition other system can support but you need to bring in here also private sectors our harambee prosperity plan target was 80 percent we are at 83 percent on 3g currently and at 34 on 4g but our target is to reach 95 percent countrywide broadband coverage by the year 2023 2024 financial year as it stands namibian towns are at different levels in terms of their covered 19 infection rates whereas in some areas the ministry has lifted the ban and some children have and will be returning to nurseries and schools for face-to-face learning we have got courses which are very much laboratory intensive so this courses students need to have hands-on skills where they have to do things and we have to teach them certain skills they have to apply when they go to industry like i just mentioned we we have got a department of health sciences these students are going to work with patients and when they work with patients they need to have certain skills which they've acquired here and those so some of those skills you cannot basically assimilate them online you have to have the student in front of you go in there and teach them to do specific things that they are going to apply so when when covid beat we were the challenge where now we cannot now simulate those aspects so we need the students here and i'm happy that with the current status quo we have already managed to put together a program where we are going to have them back on campus when the conditions are right based on what the the bosses in management say we're going to have them here and we're going to do block modules for those so that we attend to those critical hands-on skills they need to do despite the gradual opening of educational facilities others are preparing for the unforeseen the namibia university of science and technology is one among those whose learning and teaching unit did not cease operations they invested thoughtfully in the upgrading of their e-learning system we cannot just think in the current pandemic we have to think post covert 19 and like i said this will not be this is not the first pandemic it will not be the last and we are staying in a country we we you know because of climate changes this drought these floods and we cannot every time find ourselves in a position whereby we are not ready so we have to we have to build on our successes what we have achieved during this time and remote teaching and learning is here to stay and it's i'm not saying that we must replace the face-to-face teaching in its entirety but the two needs to complement each other mr lumumu  so it works well the feedback works well so i'm just going to replicate this drawing that we have there of the system that's that's indicated on the book needless to say e-learning comes with advantages and disadvantages the system we are calling um we are using ms teams where we are able to to talk with our students you know like almost face to face one of the things we have realized and i was actually mentioning to someone this morning is that uh students you can tell students login you see them there but they're not communicating they go up they most probably they've gone to do their own things but there you can see they're showing presents there and how i've caught that is sometimes i'll ask a question and you'll find it's the same same students answering then you look at who is on on on on online and you tell them so and so can you answer this and they don't you can't hear anything so you know that student is not there they could even be asleep for all you know they just log in and then they you know so that in itself when we had face to face you can see who doesn't answer you know there are students who really are not uh talkative so what you are able to do is you're able to you know tell them so and so can you tell me something about this now it's a bit challenging engineering and i think most science based programs um poses an additional challenge to e-learning in that you can't simply give the students slides you can't just simply talk to them you know give them sound bites for instance you have to actually explain problems to them solve problems mathematical problems on on a blackboard or whiteboard and that takes some doing and to do that online is is quite a challenge and then furthermore assessments are also difficult because you want the students to be able to write equations on paper and you have to look through their methods of solving a problem and then mark accordingly which is different from say human sciences in times of financial stress and the diversion of resources to address the coronavirus pandemic the government is looking at remedial means to address existing challenges students will be will have access to surmountable amount of of of capacity to enable students to download material for their for their studies for their research for engagement with their lecturers for responding to assignments we have a core core area which is the education and um and skills developments where unesco is um actually chairing the working group we have uh we have a sub pillar on education and skills of the umpaf we call it umpaf the the un partnership framework supporting ndp5 unesco is sitting here supporting the as a chair of the educations and skills but also we are involved in other areas the ministry through this task force that i referred to earlier the e-learning task force they're exploring nego they are actually negotiating in depth with the telecommunication providers models of this nature so that that is what what they are engaged in currently the the costing for this uh all together you know it depends on which way we go it has been resolved by the ministry of higher education through unam and nast and particularly the namibia student financial assistance fund to to to make gadgets accessible and available cost effectively to those learners who may not have the means to buy laptops and gadgets of similar nature that will assist them in benefiting and capitalizing on the available connectivity connectivity unesco we uh through uh a cooperation with china right we have implemented here a project that uh supports the the development of what you call acopano kopano is a is a is a platform is a is an e-platform where we are expecting and we are pushing trying to have the the the teachers to come in and collaborate but this kopano can also be used as a tool for indeed to be expanded for to serve for the e-learning while some believe that the unplanned and rapid move to online learning with no training insufficient bandwidth and little preparation will result in a poor user experience that is unconducive to sustained growth others believe that a new hybrid model of education will emerge with significant benefits i think this the e-learning system is mostly designed for the privilege there's a lot of integrity issues and i'll tell you that because i have looked at i've given a number of assignments to some of the classes before and you can see how students perform a student who gets 40 out of 100 or gets 50 out of 100 and suddenly they are you're giving them an assignment online and they're getting 80. you know there's an issue of integrity um so those are the issues that are tricky about online teaching how are we going to fight to figure out how to deal with the issues of integrity but i feel if we embrace it looking at where we are now uh even after covid this might be the best platform for students to learn the my thought process is coming from this end if you look at a lot of people in this country have gotten degrees through online learning if you look at the models that universities like unisa and other uk universities are using they teach students in namibia to get a degree online and you have never been to the uk my concern is if there would be again a national lockdown or if there would be if schools would be closed that would of course have very adverse effects on the examinations we don't want that we want to find a new normal that is the position of the ministry of education arts and culture e-learning is possible it cannot be hundred percent we we need to be thrusted into embracing e-learning we have no turning back the tide is pushing us in that direction it's not a question of choice but we know there will be those that will be challenged in terms of access to e-services to e-learning rome was not built in one day we we have started and we are in that matching in that direction so we need to harness our resolve as a nation and not to think twice but think once and move forward one day we will all be smiling with no one feeling left out  you
[Laughter]  [Laughter]  [Laughter]  [Laughter]  welcome to our Africa tag segment technology is catching up ain't teaching methodologies across the education space and teachers are already bringing the vital elements of experience and discovery to the classroom using various technological tools the New Age teacher understands that students are increasingly exposed to various communication devices and they try to integrate them in teaching methodologies our guests today TT at CC joins us to discuss ways we can make learning fun using technology thank you very much for joining us on Network Africa so we know that some kids are fine learning funny how could we make it as much fun for them as possible how do we merge learning with technology I think there's a popular saying that says if children don't learn the way you teach they have to teach them to Edelen children learn through play I think there's almost no child this day they are struggling with your phone your mobile phone and devices with so it means that that's the way that they learn so we have to bring the learning closer to the way the land which is using mobile phones using tablets and various other technology tools so for us at 9 Jackie's that's what we do we develop games that are fun so a child is willing to play a game but he's really learning about math is waning about science and he's fond to him so it's ready to learn over and over again yeah ok so games are not very powerful tools for learning how can we make use of technology in our indigenous games to at least showcase Nigeria to the world that's that's really a very good point Nigeria is known for various things ok and it's good loving stuff you know we start showing other parts of Nigeria so our culture our food and all that and we can do that with games we have games that you can dress up Lola like a knight Fulani girl you can dress up Lola like an ebow girl we are games that you can find out why the landmarks in Nigeria where the states where the food all those things are fun what tuna diamond earrings and imogen an unknown the insurance they can learn about Nigerian heroes by playing again about it much the pictures their faces much the pictures to deny run notes anything that would just be interested metal Mattel season and I know how it is because they play the game on it so it's just to tone learning in everywhere we can find it and make it a lot of fun but sometimes we know that that distractions that come with this kind of learning how do we ensure that we manage those distractions when it comes to technology from children honestly there is a structure in everything and it's important that children then at an early stage even we adults are still learning about that about the structure of how to do things in the right time in a lot of people spend a lot of time on their mobile phone when they had work so it's a skill that you continue to learn but the good thing about learning with games is that even though it's a distraction they are still learning and even in the games they are also teaching them about values it's not actually a legitimate values of doing things in the right time so they will always have to be everything has to be done in moderation things always have to have boundaries and restrictions so it's not different with games it's not different with technology in everything in life there has to be moderation but sometimes we see where this kind of things happen this type of learning you're talking about we see most of them in private schools in Nigeria especially but how can schools especially government schools manage funding if they want to buy into this kind of learning you're talking about honestly technology is still not readily available for everyone what's important is that we have to promote quality education education today that is not in technology when it's not quality education because any job you're doing today has one bit of technology no matter how simple the job is why we appreciate this challenges Nantucket is willing to work with government agencies private institution public schools private schools in making the technology platform all available and this is something to continue to do the good thing about technology is that world technology consumers is the big laptops technology now in the form of the phone is really now available mechanic hazard everybody has is your hairdresser has it so these games can also be played on the phone so just assume your child most of this time are dragged in the phones from that parent it means that apart from plane just no more games they can actually play educational games on those top so it's not only when they come to the school environment you don't know when you have all the white interactive boards even with their phones they can be plane learning and having fun so for parents to think of buying a phone for six-year-old is it's not good what would what advice are you giving them honestly buying a phone that gives them access to social media is not a good idea I will stand with that but if you're using it as a learning tool because that is real still the cheapest form of technology that we have if it's a tool that they can do and they're playing games on it educational games that they are learning their ABCs they want to twist and it's right there no it's no longer that worry and our fear because the fear of using technology and giving your child a phone is that you don't know who they are talking with you don't know who is their friend there you know having their friends on Facebook and Instagram so that is would be a challenge but if you can use it as a learning tool then I would say go for it all right I know am your about games but I don't been meaning to ask this there were cartoons actually help children learn yes honestly we learn in so many ways when we were young do you know what we learned we will enter songs remember the past that's not real it I'm to today if you actually said that was us it was it was songs but for them now it is music it is TV and it is games so we have to move a bit to learn what they are learning for them to learn that so we have to embrace technology because if you're not the truth is that they are doing it behind you so you might as well embrace it and find out what it is that they are learning I mean sure that it's educational because there's so many TV programs are not all educational some are so advanced even me they are you know it's really for us to also watch what they are whatever sure it's educational we need sure that we you know I've had to the parental guidance but they are very medication you'll miss me a child knows from watching my sacred Mississippi when I have to say that I have to sing it to remember the spelling okay alright thank you very much it's the idea we'll see thanks for your time on network Africa you for having me and that's the program today thank you so much for watching this week's edition pub Network Africa see you again very soon [Laughter]  [Laughter]  
hello and welcome to maseno university elearning portal uh we're going to get started by getting to know how to navigate the e-learning portal so to get to access the maseno university e-learning portal you need to open your browser and type in the url elearning.maseno.ac.ke once you type in the url you will be able to access the login page which is currently displayed on your screen now you should enter your username i am typing in my username and your password now once you have typed in your username and password and click on the login button the site will be able to log you in that is assuming your credentials are okay so the site will log you in and take you directly to the maseno university home page now on the top uh section of the homepage are links to my courses my profile exam timetable schools and faculties these are links to frequently visited sections of the site by the users who log into the site now in the second section of the site atlanta support service is a learner support services area whereby there are links to discussion forums or forums where the epcs or the ecompass program coordinators interact with the students from their various schools now uh the next section on the e-learning homepage is the e-library which is access to the e-library databases past papers open educational resources and then under under platform or a space where you can interact with the e-librarian now how do you access the courses that you are working on now to access the courses that you are working on you use the my courses link when you click on my courses it will open uh the page or what you call your dashboard on your dashboard you're able to access all the activities and courses that you are currently enrolled in you cannot be able to access a course which you are not enrolled in now uh on your dashboard there are two links there's a timeline and courses now what is the difference between timeline and courses now the timeline is a list of all activities within the courses that you are working on including the time the timelines of those particular activities for example if there's a dude if there's an assignment that is due there's a chart that is due there is a a discussion forum that you need to have posted in there's an assignment that needs to have been submitted all this information will appear on the timeline now on the courses link it is a section whereby you're able to access all the courses that you are working on then usually categorized into three categories the first one is in progress in progress are courses that you are currently working on in a given semester now the courses that appear in the future are courses that are submitted to be taken in the future for example if there's a an activity or a course that is scheduled for uh maybe a month or two from now it should be appearing in the future under the past tab is all courses that you did in the past for example the past courses that you have been enrolled in at the e-compass if you're a facilitator the courses that you've been teaching in the past will appear in that particular section so can you i would like to encourage you to take time to navigate the e-learning portal so that you're able to learn all the features that are available for you on the e-learning portal thank you
main reason why we are here is just to get an orientation on this e-learning program i have had a lot of concerns from the comrades when i said you try to enroll for the units some people are telling me last name 2.2 or 3.1 it means they were going to their student photo to try and log in there which is not the case the e-learning photo is a different one so the e-learning portal whenever you are online i will share with you the words are the sites which are white listed by safaricom to use this bundle see zoom is one of them youtube and the website of yahoo so i will share with you the white listed sites so that you can see them so when you want to get uh to enroll for the units you are supposed to sign in the e-learning portal not the student bottom not the www.maraud.sc slash portal no you're supposed to be doing the e learning photo which you are created earlier i understand there are people who are facing challenges because they have created it when they joined first year but they can't remember the user anymore the password but if yours is sorted and you have the username and the password then you are supposed to open a browser you're supposed to open a browser either in your phone or a laptop for a desktop or whenever site you are joining from uh so i'll be sharing a screen and showing you the steps you're supposed to be following for you to be joining through so when you are used in your phone or whichever browser you are going through you are supposed to open after you open the browser then you are supposed to click in and search for a tab now you type e-learning i hope you can be able to see my screen e-learning then you search if you clicking then you search if you can see my screen i hope you can see what it is bringing to me it will bring for you that page which you are seeing there and it will ask you at the top right corner there's a place written log in so if you had already registered with the e-learning platform so it means you will be seeing what i am seeing right now here so you click at the top right corner you click login after you have clicked logged in it will bring for you your username if you have saved your username or you clicked or you've checked in the box of remember username you will be having your username already there like my enrollers again who is already there so i don't need to put my username again so what i'm just required to put there is my password so you after you've put in keyed in your username so you key in now your password so that you can access the photo itself so i will be putting in my password now it's a bit complicated because of the reasons that you know when you are registering there are some conditions that you are supposed to put so that your password would fit so after you have put or you've kid in your password you click log in just the green bar down there so if your password is correct it will open the bottom the auto photo will be open for you and now if you are viewing it in a computer or a laptop you will be seeing the screen what i am seeing right now here which i hope you two are also seeing there so that one you have logged in into the autumn now the e-learning bottle now you are inside there you have not done anything you have not registered any unit you are just in the bottom now up to there up to there what we are supposed to be doing right now is enrolling for the units i hope if you tried earlier to endorse the units you are finding that in the human resource sector only uh a unit there was only one unit so you if you check right now you will be finding different units there so they will be having the code the unit codes will be there you will be finding the holy words so when you find the unit codes there you are supposed to be clicking on that unit which you want to register just a minute or we which you want to enroll i mean which one to enroll so if i take for example now you are a hr student and you have kid in your details and now you are in the bottom and you are seeing the things i'm seeing there so as you are in the portal now on the right side there are some things written there this navigation dashboard site home site pages courses so you click on the courses now if you click on the courses ah sorry for that i request if you're in another place please just mute your microphone ah so that you avoid interruption so after you have clicked the courses bar you will be having phd programs postgraduate programs undergraduate programs diploma programs such speaker programs then you have the short courses so like for us we are undergraduate programs that's the bachelor so you click at the undergraduate programs just still on the right hand side of your screen and then you will be finally the undergraduate programs listed there so you scroll you get to scroll down till you reach bachelor of science in human resource management so you just click like now i hope you can see where my pointer is you can see their bachelor of science in human resource management so because you are a hr student you click after you've clicked on the bachelor of science in human resource management you will be finding course codes listed there for example the first one is bhr 4203 that code is for a 4.2 student you don't need to bother the second one is vhr209 that is guidance and counselling 2.2 cost so you are supposed to enroll on that unit the following one is 2205 that is also hours 2204 hours 2203 hours so all those four units are tackled by dr sankey and he's the only one i'm seeing has uploaded the 2.2 units because he was taking us through the four so he has already uploaded them there so you will be seeing the courses there because so i hope i don't know if the holiday has been long till we have forgotten the course course but i hope you can trace but when you see 22 even if you don't know the the other one next week 22 or 2.2 cost that is the hr 2.2 so for example let us use the phr 2209 human resource maintenance that is the counseling one was 2205 sorry so 2209 human resource maintenance you click on it if you what went wrong then it will ask you and run for this course but i hope if you can see what is in a blue bar in the blue bar says that you cannot enroll yourself in this course so there are still some shortcomings and if you even try the 220405 and even let me do this 2203 you are still finding the century back you cannot enroll yourself in this case so that's the feedback we are getting right now but we are working on it because they have still put the portal so that lecturers can upload all the units still so i hope up to there we are okay after that we are okay if you can log in and get up to the courses so that when that is open when the moment the photo is open and allows you to enroll for the course you cannot get stuck anywhere up to there so i hope you have followed up to there and that if you are to enroll then you would have enrolled and it would be asking you the enrollment key yeah if it is okay for enrollment it will be asking the enrollment key of which i'll be providing it i'll be liaising with the lecturer and i'll be forwarding the enrollment key for each and every unit so if you are going there some people are claiming that because they are not seeing the units that cost they use the term courses for the units which you are doing so don't say human resources are cost and the another one is a cost so the units in short they call them courses so you click there so that you find the courses which you are registered for so that you can enroll in them so the moment it is enabled enabled i will be having the enrollment key and i'll be sharing it so that you can get to enroll ah for the units for the rather than courses so up to there i would like to just take some concerns and some questions if at all they'll be there so that i can help through maybe you are tried through the same process and you have faced a challenge at some point or you didn't go through the same process i hope if you're using a phone it will still have the same process and you have maybe faced a difficulty at some point so that i can maybe i can help you address if at all i have the capability to so i hope up to there we are all well and maybe you can just admit your microphone and raise a concern if at all it's there yes anyone with a concert question yes the units they are not named units they are written process so under the courses button is where you will get a unit those are the units you are doing or if you click under the courses you will find the units they have not named their units but they are the same [Music] or rather how they call it you cannot enroll because they have not enabled enrollment the lecturers are still king in the units so you cannot enroll steam grassroots whenever it will be enabled you just know but if you can reach there you are going to go just keep it there we'll make sure when it is out you will just be notified okay ah yes yes uh you are saying something i muted you i don't know if you are having something are you okay okay okay any other person with any other concern question season m uh um so maybe we just give them time because the lecturers were also convinced that the system was not easy so i think they have been added more time so that they can upload the courses roughly yeah so uh i cannot estimate exactly but the moment it is enabled we just get to know because we are always checking up on that regularly all right okay down okay then it is okay you are okay many people are forgetting their username and password and any other thing and it was very difficult yeah okay and for those who are going to the student photo to register for the unity the student photo uh right now it is disabled and you cannot i have no tried but i if you try i hope it will tell you the deadline something like that as fast okay have that mean just leave the student photo alone just focus on the e-learning so the moment anything will go on foreign [Music] [Applause] this one is lagging behind if you solve this one but we hope now we are waiting for the lecturers to upload the units because the bundles the institution has given us we are waiting for the lecturers [Music] i hope maybe you will get the recordings i'll be sharing the recordings uh youtube is white listed by safaricom so if i share it in the youtube i hope you will get also through it but i'll also get bands because of this network at least that i'll get buttons to share it if the what's up for those who have not received bundles i received complaints of some feel uh a lot of shade but i'll also get to share it in youtube foreign just keep the recording so that we can continue chatting on musa
yes let me proceed yes uh uh morning everyone my name is Alessia I am in the ICT Department maybe the classroom can if one of them is in it can just give a brief of how the class has been and what are some of the challenges thank you proceed chariot okay good morning everyone I am Brian chariot and first of all welcome sir for taking your time to come and do a bit of sensitization to us following a number of officials that had been raised by the students so uh in regards to class we have been having a seamless flow of classes whoever some of us have not been receiving class links via their emails and also we had issues with regards to accessing recordings so I think those are the major issues that we are really looking up to you to sort out yeah thank you Brian is there anything anything else unless the semiata concern from the students they can raise them directly okay have you been able to yes have you been able to check it even  proceed James Ruth Ruth foreign can you hear me yes yes personally I would like to request the first week of recording there's some recordings I was not able to when you link when you go to the link it's how it's it kind of has to it's it gives you some notifications that you have to ask for permission to access the recordings so if that can go so object on that would be okay thank you okay good morning how to access the library virtually the library naturally is that part of your training or we'll have to wait for people from the library you wait for the guys in the lab Library do that training all right thank you Ruth then I explain okay I'm sorry my hand is up I think I just did not take it down sorry now great so uh regarding class links uh if anyone has not uh has not been able to receive the class links yeah you just send an email to through your personal email just send an email to AV support ksl.ac.ke  you will see how to sort you out but I think most of you now have been receiving links the academic department is still here to send the final list they still have to send the final list so that we compile all the groups think there are still some guys who are still registering as at now maybe by Friday uh then we'll have the complete groups uh so let me show you how the links look like those who Maybe have been sent the links through WhatsApp I think you guys have created a WhatsApp group for the class so allow me to share something foreign so that is how the your Outlook email looks like but before you get to that you can I say the first thing you need to do is go to office.com in there you'll find a list of all the applications that are available to you under the top left if you click on that those nine dots on the top left you'll see a list of all the application there is Outlook OneDrive where you can store your documents Microsoft Word Excel PowerPoint so when you are given an assignment you can do uh if it is a PowerPoint presentation you can do it all through PowerPoint or if it is our document you can still type it through this is still the normal Word document okay so you are still able to type like that but this one is saved on the cloud so it's it is easier to retrieve regarding Microsoft teams when you want to Now do Farm worker when you want to have a farm meeting still Microsoft teams is still here once you click on it you'll be able to set up a meeting okay so you can sign in with another user you sign in with your school email foreign sometimes it tells you to open with the Microsoft teams that you've installed on your computer sometimes it's also requests you to use the browser so when it is uh based on what the kind of internet that you have you can still use the browser or the application that you've installed on the computer but if you are using a phone remember that you have to have both Microsoft teams and Outlook installed and sometimes when it tells you to open as a guest is because you've not logged into your Microsoft teams with a school account so if you have already an account in your mobile device you just add another account so there there is a calendar so the calendar you just create a new meeting you can set your meeting or or just click the plus to create a new meeting then I said um you can say from one meeting then you based on if you are Farm members just start with the admission number like that let's assume it is uh kasamba so you just add all of them 2023 0 0 2 okay like that then you you send it will be sent the same way you receive the links on on your outlook the link will still be sent to their personal their school email okay so that is how you send a meeting okay so Outlook click on home Outlook Office Outlook of office.com Outlook or you can just type this URL here outlook.office.com you'll be able to log in with your school email and also be able to also you can also create meetings through the calendar I think there is a calendar here okay okay so you can look at all those applications that are here okay and again when you are doing your meetings remember to take the attendance so that you attach it when you are given the Project work you should be able to attach it on on on your project work okay the other issue was on the issue of the recordings all the classes are recorded So the ICT Department Records all the classes but for storage purposes uh we download those recordings and use a platform that is called e-learning so he does visit e-learning .ksl.ac.ae okay so uh you'll be required to log in I think most of you have received the login details and uh maybe the password might be complex if you are not able to copy it you can reset the password through this link forgotten your username or password so you just click on this link and you type your username which is your admission number like that or your email address which is now your school email at 18p .ksl.ac.ke okay and when you are just click on search based on what you've typed you click on search it will send you a uh a link to reset your password I think the password is a bit complex because it it is set up by the the system so but when you are able to log in you should be able to see the recordings for for other subjects you have simple litigation criminal litigation so just click on let's say so I'll ask for so civil litigation 2023 all of them have a 2023 at the end to differentiate them from the class of 2022 and 2021 so you just click on this one you'll be able to see all the recordings for all the online classes class c f and g and once you click on a link like this one you'll be taken to YouTube okay you click on the link again it opens in YouTube okay and you are able to play okay okay so the reason you will not be able to to find them on Microsoft's platform once you click it requires you to to login but the class has been set up by ICT and ICT you attended as an attendee so the best way to check those recording is through the e-learning okay is there any other question Irene um hi I was wondering if there's a way we can check our attendance well uh four classes just because sometimes you know if your internet times out and and you're out of class for a few minutes I was just wondering if there's a way we can check our attendance records through the semester uh the the recording that the register is captured by the ICT Department maybe if you are worried that it is not captured you can get in touch with the ICT Department okay thank you Rosalie good morning uh still on assessing uh the the previous classes yes for example um when you click on the e-learning link um for example I didn't attend the first week class because of issues with my email and links yes so it's the classes that I didn't attend they don't appear there so and when I went to the saved um saved class recordings uh they weren't there okay we will check uh all the recordings whether they have been uploaded so that uh if there is one that is missing it will be updated but if uh maybe one of the class was not recorded you can still check the other class maybe Class C F and G but if the class is still missing if you think there's a lesson that is missing you can inform the ICT so that we see whether they are similar lesson that was done for the previous class that is Eva told the the whole uh lesson that was taught at that time is missing thank you they can only be suspect it was a decision to direct that I think the lecturer is in if there is any other question you can still send it to through the class rep or to the ICT Department through AV support class wrap that that one is with the director for direction of what you need to do it's okay Mr quinoa have a good day have a good and a good class guys
and either choose to join a meeting or else to sign into your account when you sign into audio account it's going to open the browser and then verify there are several ways of signing into your account that we are going to look at as well but today we are going to look at the option of join a meeting this is the most common problem that we have realized over time so when you click on join a meeting they will open another window where you can put in the meeting credentials the first part is the meeting id then the next part is your name very many people have been connecting to meetings even up to now we can see them and they have devices with the device name instead of their participant name because i can see we have people who have enrolled as infinix hot five samsung galaxy j2 and this is where we fix this part then you select you select remember my name for future meetings this helps to retain your name that even as you enroll into most zoom sessions you can still keep the name you don't have to enter the name every time so then you're going to click on join once the meeting has not yet started you will get a screen similar to what you're seeing on your screen right now please wait for the host to start this meeting this is so common for simple meetings when you choose to be ali than the teacher and i know today very many of you have seen this screen but then once the meeting starts you already go to the screen where you can simply log in and i want to talk about a few parts of this and this is on our next slide whenever you're hosting a zoom you're going to have the following features you're going to have the mute i don't know if all of you can see can see the mute here several times before you connect your audio there is going to be a microphone with a headphone on it and an arrow facing upwards and some of you have been saying for us we are not hearing we cannot hear you even when i speak people cannot hear me it is simply because you have not connected your audio from here and once you connect your audio you can always mute when you're not you can always mute when you're not speaking all the time so that you can get a chance to listen now for these sessions we have just chosen that we mute everyone so that they just listen to that teacher and unmute when they want to also we mute the video because you don't want to be in a meeting and people are looking at you and they are wondering what is happening in the background we can see people are saying things people are dressed inappropriately because you're not ready so if you're not ready to post your screen you just have to stop the video and this is this option here you can click for example when i click there you realize my video is gone and when i click back my video is back on another option i want us to look at is for the participants this will display the participants list and then you can choose to make another participant a co-host you can choose to make another participant the host in case your data is unreliable now just like for this session i made rogers mukalile the host so that he can keep handling the station as i teach that means in case something is going wrong i don't have to worry about the meeting all i have to worry about is am i delivering correctly am i saying the right things am i clicking in the right places otherwise everything to do with the live streaming with the recording is all up to the host another very important key is the chatroom sometimes our devices have problems with the microphone and we cannot speak back so what we will do instead is click on chat and start chatting and start chatting hello this is happening hello this is happening hey this is happening instead of the recording option it is a better option because you don't have to be interrupted by anything by anyone you just have to flow and keep it natural you don't have to stress a lot about it then another important thing this is one thing i want to put a lot of attention to you realize i've been running through all the other things this is the most important thing share screen as we share through zoom we want to share our screen that people can see it just like you can see mine and the way to do it is clicking on the share screen arrow so when you click on it here it will open up options of which to select which screen you want to share and then the screen that you share is the screen that will be recorded very many people have been struggling this now if you want to share a powerpoint presentation first you open the powerpoint on its own then you start presenting by pressing f5 then once the presentation starts press the home the windows key to open the taskbar then once the taskbar is open i want you to select zoom and then when you click on share screen you select that screen that has powerpoint presentation are we still together then another thing i want us to look at is the reactions finally aunt has to look at the reaction menu and under reactions this is where we get to choose the different the different reactions raising up your hand if you want to club if you want to set an emoji and things of the sort okay so i'm going to take you straight to the zoom where we can download and install it so we are going to head to our browsers and click on zoom and type zoom.os  so once you open up zoom you're going to see a lot of features this is their website the zoom website and they have a lot of features that they communicate about their zoom they have the plans and pricing and then but to download we're going to head over to resources and then the first thing you're going to look at is download zoom client i want us all to click here so once you click on the download zoom client they're going to open up the downloads page and this has several features the very first feature is zoom client for meetings this is for the computers so it's going to give you an option for the 32-bit operating system and the 64-bit operating system so all you have to do is click the download button if you're under 32-bit just click the download button but if you under 64 bit you just go ahead here and click it also you may want a zoom plug-in for microsoft outlook for people who don't have stable machines and you need to embed zoom into your outlook and we also have zoom for browsers people who are using chrome and firefox they do this a lot and then finally we have a client plugin for the iphones and ipads so once the download is complete you're going to need to install and once you install zoom they're going to take you to a screen similar to where we started if all of you remember where we started you remember the presentation it's going to lead you straight here and then the next thing you're going to have to do is sign in so in our page on our google classroom we have set an assignment for 1pm for people to be able to log into their zoom create a meeting just take a screenshot or a short video of the zoom meeting you've created and post it we will be reviewing and will be assisting thank you so much  back to euro jazz okay thank you very much uh mr moses for that quick quick quick we have scratched the the surface and uh we are first we we are having a number of things that we are going to really be discussing on more about zoom but i want us to first get some feedback uh from the members what to get some members uh give some questions at this time then we are going to be coming in as we respond to the questions we are going to be sharing more we have some tutorials we have prepared uh how to do these things on phone how to do these things on computer we are going to be sharing more tutorials during this time of introduction we have only one hour so shall be using one hour to uh to to touch the surface and introduce concepts but we shall be using our whatsapp group and the google classroom to discuss and share more of the tech of the detailed things yes so at this time let me first get some members uh to share with us uh some of the challenges that they have made with zoom and uh uh something that they think uh we need to talk about mr nissan cayamba yes um i appreciate the work he doing is uh what it was all about uh i thought that guys uh for sure i didn't understand it very well as it was closing up i'm sorry guys but i didn't understand it very well you didn't understand what this and kian but we didn't get your question why didn't you understand just tell us what you want to learn because we have not taught all we have just discussed a few things what exactly do you want i found the guy almost concluding i'm sorry i tuned in some work to the other side of the google class so i don't know i'm saying you know i'm saying when i tuned in i phoned the gentleman almost concluding i found the gentleman almost concluding telling us that he's going to put some work to the other side of the class and he was explaining something about the okay listen we have recorded this yes i missed the beginning part  check out the youtube channel we ever send you the link and you watch it from there thank you mr peter mister peter yeah yes good afternoon lodges  afternoon i've been using zoom but the only challenge i've met our irish smartphone not a computer but the challenge i find here in the powerpoint those powerpoint files and what the document so no smartphone sharing on phone on the phone and what the document i only using the pdf files that one i can share but when it comes to powerpoint and the what are the documents there is a challenge there yes okay so that is one point moses please take note of that sharing uh on phone sharing uh a powerpoint on phone uh so we shall be talking about that let us get another hand mister kenneth newman we are going to get 10 people 10 people now then we we share more we have some tutorial here that we are going to display about controlling a zoom meeting and then we shall be wrapping up but we won't first get to hear from you this time so kenneth then we have willy wonka uh co-hosts please you try to and help animate these people when we mention them yes having really yes yes my point is not so different from the one of peter about the screen i had mr moses talking about to open the powerpoint presentation and because as he peter said me too i'm using a phone but also i find it such a challenge in pairing the powerpoint with the document and i have it on the presentation on sharing the screen so i would wish him to elaborate more on how to go about that okay sharing the screen using a mobile yes okay that is good yeah thank you very much yes let us get the next person let us hear from peace crossover hello can you hear me now hello yes we can hear you please okay yes i was wondering what is the difference between the 32-bit and 64-bit when he was uh telling us uh on how to showing us how to download zoom uh client for meetings okay so there was something about choosing between 32 bits and 64 bits i was wondering what is the difference between those okay thank you moses take note of that thank you very much for this great work indeed we appreciate i personally am fair with the zoom and i've conducted some lectures for some good time but i have a general question like the kind of network disturbances in some regions as ital is there any um any program you are setting to see that you link with the network of people to see that uganda get a bit more advanced in the network worker provision and accessibility because some parents are having challenges due to location access of network and really this is the way to go we appreciate the move so internet problem is my question now in brief thank you okay okay thank you very much uh madame garetty uh for that question maybe like i can just respond to that quickly um before we get uh uh naomi yeah so internet you see there are many stakeholders involved in this and the stakeholders have different roles in uganda the companies which is in charge of having internet move and the prevalence increases known as the grand communications commission and they have been doing a lot over the last years to make sure that they coordinated the telecommunication providers to make sure that internet access and prevalence goes high and uh we have okay just been discussing this in some forum according to this statistics around 50 percent of uganda uh people have access to internet because they have got the smartphones and but still there are places where there is still a challenge so that is it comes in from different stakeholders government comes from budgeting when government is making a budget how much is being provided to ict and and also making sure that the internet penetration increases so it is not something that utah can do there are also other agencies like um renu which are supporting schools to access internet uh ucc has what you call the other cdf communication movement fund where which they are using make sure that even in the rural areas network is there so we shall be getting there as the advancement goes but for now we shall we are doing this and the e-learning to support the those who can connect you now others will be joining a new course okay thank you very much uh let us get another hand uh let us get mr ivan getting back to the presentation yes hello yes yes i wanted to learn about okay let us get three more hands uh let us get rachel rachel and teacher rose yes rachel  hello yes my concern okay i've really not picked anything so i don't know i'm going to go about the assignment thank you okay thank you very much so let us get the final person it has here from artik robot yes thank you very much members here yes yes i'm getting you thank you very much members uh i have a question on how i can be able to allow an attendee yeah his screen when i'm presenting okay i didn't get that stock was talking about screenshots okay so i think moses you can come in and respond to some of those questions then we shall get some other uh facilities as well on board if they have some other questions they can react to uh also members are sending some messages through the chat and the chats are going to the facilitators on the so if there's a possibility who has got a question in the chat please uh you can be able to we shall be able to come in there um so moses first respond to that and then uh i'll be sharing here some video about controlling a meeting so moses thank you so much rogers so i wanted to cover how to create and sign up for a zoom account so you go you go to zoom.qs  and on the bar there is an option of sign up and signing so we can choose each of any of these but since we do not have accounts we're going to select the sign up option loading speed depends on your name and your location then they'll give you an option to input your email address some browsers are going to ask for some browsers are going to even ask for edge confirmation they will want to confirm if you're above 18 years of age so then we are going to select the option to sign up with google it is the easiest option other options are viable you could have an email address that is not google and you can enter it here so i'm going to enter a private email and then i click on sign up and then it will take it will send an email with a confirmation link so that i go and confirm that email but then for us i want us to look at the option to do it with google because it makes things not only easier but it's easier to have everything with one google account so i'll enter my google account  and then oh like i said sometimes i want to confirm so i'll enter the date pretty quickly sixth of august yes you can put anything let me put 90 watts  even 2 000 is okay and then continue and then they'll welcome you to zoom and then you have to click on create account once you create account you'll be immediately logged into your zoom account and if you already have a zoom assistant on your desktop it will automatically capture this and that is when the problem of scheduling will come in here is when you have options of meeting so you can say host a meeting you can join a meeting or you can schedule a meeting these three options are also available to people who are using the desktop version because they'll show you join a meeting host a meeting or schedule a meeting so if you want to have your meeting later this is the best option you'll click on schedule a meeting if you want to have the meeting right now you just host a meeting basic zoom meetings have 40 minutes so you will come here and put the topic test test meeting description this is a test meeting to test my zoom account then you set you schedule that day when you want the meeting to start so this is okay but that's very far maybe we can have it yeah third of august then you set the time duration we say basic has 40 minutes so we shall we can set something less than 40 minutes then you set the timing we want it in gmt plus 3 east african time sorry then if it is a meeting that you keep having it is better when you select recurring meeting but under options select no fixed time when you don't select a fixed time it means the meeting is open and bound to sit anytime and this is what teachers need because when you set it to be recurring daily that means it will have to bother you with notifications every day if you select weekly that means you cannot have it every day it will have to happen once a week so you select no fixed time and once you select no fixed time you select you set a passcode for the meeting i'll select maybe 85 remember this is for training purposes only the next option would be the waiting room i strongly discourage people from using the waiting room i strongly discourage because sometimes you come into the meeting a little late sometimes you have disruptions and you purposely have to admit everyone into their meeting because everybody will be logged on to the waiting room so this will not activate then for video you can choose on if you want your video to be on but i strongly advise for participant video to be off so that you're not disturbed imagine someone joining and then the market and then they have to struggle to switch off their camera yet you can just switch off then the meeting options allow participants to join anytime new to participants upon entry that's very key for students so that when they join in they don't join in with background noise then automatically record meeting on the local computer that is a searching you may need in case you want to share for example the basic account can not cannot record to cloud so that means you need to have a local recording for your youtube channel and that is where this feature becomes key you might need to take this as well so approve or block entry for users from specific countries i don't think we are segregating any country members but in case you are you can select it and they'll ask you for the different countries then you click on save and then the test meeting is scheduled you can see the passcode and you can also see the meeting id this is what we keep sharing on all platforms for people that are having issues sharing their screens on mobile we are going to record a small step-by-step video i'm not going to share it on our tab group and also keep it in the files in the google classroom and also the youtube channel thanks rogers i think then about the bit of the device moses you can know the bit of your device by typing pressing the windows key and r and then you're going to you're going to press the windows key  and r then the next thing you're going to type dxdiag this is the directx diagnostics it is going to help you know your computer type it tells you a lot about your computer and to share my screen here so you can see about my computer please don't laugh at me it's a little old so here it shows that my computer is running windows 10 pro 64 bit this is how we know the beat of your operating system to some computers it will show windows 10 pro 32-bit 64-bit processor but the most important key here is knowing the bit here 64 bits so if it is 32 bit it will show 32 bit if it is an older version of windows say windows 7 it might show x 86 that is also the same annotation for 64 bits moses may i maybe try to answer that question of 32 64. all right so members uh 64-bit computers these are these are architectures the those guys who built the computer they built two versions there's 64 32 where the earlier version and 64 are the newer versions so most of the computers that are coming in these are kind of offline or mario you want to take it from here dennis yes yes i'm on so 64 uh they are built and they have their the software's are compatible like if you are not compatible if you download for example zoom that is meant for 32 and you try to install in 64 it will not work the same as drivers and other softwares if you try to install vlc vlc i think works across both platforms but most of the software that are designed for 32 don't work on 64 and the same with 64 they don't work in 62. i mean 32 so it is important that you check your computer like the way moses showed you if it is saying 64-bit then you have to download software that is uh that is meant for 64-bit because it's always indicated on it 16 windows 1064 or 32 so this is just for software compatibility thank you rogers are you there yes ah i don't know rodgers is off i think his network has dropped but uh we can we can go to the we can go to the next uh moses rogers is saying you make him a host okay working on that yeah so maybe we can have some questions as rogers come concerning what moses has just shared now because uh this is this should be an interactive session really again yes i think i want to answer this question of network uh-huh they were talking about network network is also about the devices if you are having a free a 3g enabled network device internet maybe this may disturb you so if you get a 4g enabled device you you can even you can get a faster internet hello hello are you hearing me yes we are hearing you rogers i have a question getting you the question was yes okay uh as it tries to come back do we have any other question that we can ask while he's trying to come back just raise your hand so we can there's someone yes prescopia peace your hand is up yes um i was still uh wondering on about the the 32 and and 64 bit because when he was teaching us i did not understand the relevance of it so i did not understand clearly i don't remember very well where when i'm supposed to be filling that in is it at the time when i'm just installing it will yes it is that for installation purpose is for actually software compatibility purpose like if you are installing a software bit zoom meter vlc player microsoft office you have to make sure that you check on your computer architecture which is either 64 or 32 if it is 64 you look for the software that is saying 64. uh if it is 32 you look for the software that is saying 32 so that it doesn't disturb you during the installation process does that answer your question now okay there is something i want something they want to show here on mobile because many people are asking about mobile sharing uh a screen using mobile uh so i want it's just uh something like three minutes so let us look at it and then everyone welcome to my youtube channel educated even and in today's video i will be talking about how to share your slider presentation uh during your gym classroom so for these guys first of all you need to download slides from play store i have already downloaded downloaded it you can see in my

you everyone i hope this video is really useful for you if you have anything to write just write down in the comment box below okay so uh maybe that was not a bit clear but um we are going to be sharing um uh another one also in the whatsapp group which we are going to be making yeah but uh the option for sharing screen is there it is enabled all you need to do is to have your your app open your presentation open you can create the presentation using the you can create a presentation using any app we have some apps like which you can use to create slides on the computer yeah so you can you can use uh the the ones for google drive you can use wps office so for you to share you first you have to open both you have to open the presentation first and then you join zoom uh and on zoom the the host should have enabled you to be able to share because it is one of the things that are that are within the zoom so the host must have enabled you to share the screen before you can be able to to share so when you press that share button there's a share button on the zoom when the zoom is on it will bring you in and ask you if you want to share screen so you say you allow to bring someone in there that there is some sensitive information which made you go so you can be able to to have that and then you allow and then you you share and then you wrote your presentation and you you put it in full mode and you slide it yeah so that is the technology i wanted to shoot them on my phone moses you uh dennis you wanted to say something yes i wanted to show them by sharing on my phone did you know what i i wanted to show them by sharing the slides using my phone we are not as if you are breaking a beat dennis are you getting me i'm i'm saying that i wanted to to share using my phone to show them how to share these other applications besides pdf because his major concern was that he can share the pdf but this other network he cannot moses uh there is dennis we are your

what's up groups that's okay also taking the ques some people have their hands up we take some questions then we continue with that can you say something okay can you hear me we are hearing you uh there is some gentleman i think dennis yes talking about sharing a screen on mobile i would think it would be better for us even when we are offline we download the tutorials and we teach ourselves how to share this the screen on it all right it can work better that way all right thank you let's see let's hear from kenneth yes yes yeah i have a challenge with launching the meeting on make a small pc all right now  we will get back to you in the in the chat room all right you send you send a that same some complaint in the chat room we'll get back to you in the what's up group thank you let's hear from edwin edwin cat yes yeah good afternoon to you all my challenge is when um can you allow me share can i show you where my challenge is could you allow me share yes you can go ahead okay so my challenge is when i'm sharing for example when i come to that level i wish to be helped i have a chat those ones above there thank you very much and a new question i have a challenge with using the icons up there the ones i've been showing you let me just show them to you once again when i come to annotating a challenge with using the mouse select text draw stamp that kind of thing when i'm teaching and i've shared the the screen they have done it so if i could be helped on that i'll be really very grateful thank you very much okay what you do yes please you have turned on annotation so the mouse has changed the functionality so if you want to select yes you first press escape don't remove your share okay maybe i just wanted to show you can you do it all right so edwin are you on yes i'm on so now the first option is select this helps you select different things that you've placed on your clipboard okay then the next option is for text in case you want to type something oh all right are we still on yeah yes oh i don't know what has happened to my hands let me do it again sorry just a minute i don't know what happened to my zoom they told me the meeting had ended um so so when you go to your presentation okay i was showing you the icon so when you choose that text eye icon this happens when you go to the annotator yes so once you choose that text icon this is if you want to type things for people to see okay you get that yes i get it please yeah then that draw icon is if you want to draw several different things okay it would be drawing arrows you know all those things that are in that draw option right okay and the stamp these are just small stamps they are placed all over regardless of where you put them okay are you seeing mine i'm seeing i can see them yeah you can also choose the hats okay maybe when you left the way the italian was designed then you put a hat there or something okay okay uh-huh then we have the spotlight issue this is just to highlight putting things in the spotlight okay then the eraser button is the one that deletes okay so in case you put things and you need to delete them you're going to use the eraser one thing to know about the eraser is it rubs the element one at a time so when you click on the text it removes the whole textbook oh yeah so then the format is where you choose the line width okay the font okay and your colors then we have the undo and redo same as you do them in microsoft word so if you want to clear everything at the same time just press the clear button and then clear all my

 glad to have you join us on this edition of the show today our focus is on the Nigerian string on the Internet and what we need to do to further drive adoption of dot ng domain names our tech teams share six signs your computer may have been affected by a malware spyware or even a virus there's indeed a lot lined up for you but first some tech news and updates this is tech change and I'm Chuck Emeka Advaita  the ultimate promise of technology is to make us a master the world that we command by the push of a button the science of today is the technology of tomorrow technology has really find almost every aspect of our lives and education is no exception when it comes to accessing education it is believed that online learning has brought about a more balanced approach and access to digital tools like laptops tablets mobile phones among others which have boosted the learning process an education technology firm has created a digital platform called mobile classroom indigenous to an iron setting to help students learn at their own pace according to the developers mobile classroom was created to help students learn on the go but realizes there is a very well done too savvy to score job must win during examination and in our recessions we were able to uncover that one of the major reason is the inability of the student to be able to have access to the lectures so they'll feel if we need to personalize a channel through which this commit which tend to go a long way in addressing this problem so and one of the reasons we also discover is that in most of the schools so the teacher only teaches to the de facto laptop peace at the patrol appointed time and it can all it teach at his own pace and both of the student may not have the opportunity to understand what do you know of authority to indistinct a lecture on modes a set in the feeder but when a class so our deal and again our denden that absolutely there's an effort to leverage on what is invoke for us to do de student flesh process in a protected time to education so we came up with a mobile russian the classroom that you can move which take on what which die-cast lipids that we can go into try that with and because the distorted because they be assessing the water torture school at your convenience time there are many other digital platforms available for learning but being focused on the indigenous learner sets this platform apart and it's a matter so we saw the video for you to elaine possibly because i've seen when why I don't want teaching your local content as you can understand the differences of social posting cannot be fully orders and comprehended by something like me or you because if you know understand something that's saying and the examples the milk reference to my even remote you are not familiar with I'm teaching it release an omelet referee blood the new king the glamour your family had not colleagues so what we are taught is that is why it is the port of eternity in Africa because it is integers the teachers and oka the teacher the other strontium power makes the understand what type of them they make reference to as a sample so the teach in our locality and the make reference to West Arkansas level the categories are venomous second issue category potentially category we focus on the international for Jima provinces the professional for high calcium aku so now let's have a student of second in school I am NOT I click on D second Oscar category I will don't us say to show me the list of available subjects in stem understood this is on West African syllabus on curriculum now I see the subject or less they are all destroyed in mathematics and click on what matters they shows me Avonlea root of T for mathematics and see absolute topic they are all tourists are not alone spectrum I clicker this administration then itself also and begin to teach me that topic [Applause] what were the hurdles faced the main challenge it who has these the contents how to go about the contents so probably about the content of a face that has not very visible what I think we have been able to scale their shoulders so that's one of the challenges aren't you know in a design business everything's on a puffiness for you to be able to Fitness install is a very technical very difficult one what is our challenge away cutter I live on the high departs in love open tunnels because of all this but relaxing is nowhere we can develop a look we need to partner every feature you find on the half of it when we need to partner in differently productive eyebrows features force digital education has made learning more affordable and personalized but having an online tutor that is tailored specifically for the target audience is a developments the education sector should embrace openly
hello everyone my name is dorotheem casa and i serve as the e-learning manager at uganda christian university i welcome you all our continuing students and our new students you are all welcome i know my colleague dr chair kulume went through the overall picture of e-learning but my role today is to take you through a little bit of how can you navigate through the e-learning platform what we call the uganda christian university e-learning platform or model so some of you especially the continuing students already have logon details but those that are new students we are working on your details so in order to go to our learning management system our e-learning platform there are very there are several ways you can visit our website the e-learning website you can like you can see what you do you go to your browser and you put in elearning.ucu.sc dot usg as you can see and then you arrive on our you see you a learning page this page has a lot of resources like under the students you can have student training you can help have frequently frequently asked questions you can have on campus library access you can click on off-campus library access you can get most of the resources you need as an online learner even the lecturers have their own page where they can go and get most of the information or the help that they need but even when you want help you can click on get help as you can see here and then you get the help or you make an inquiry whatever i want to ask i just know that some people put inquiries that don't concern e-learning but this one is built specifically if you have something to do with e-learning you make an inquiry here and you also have on this e-learning website we have our contact phone numbers and email address which i am also going to show you on our notepad notepad here so this is our website which also can lead you to our e-learning learning management system and in order to reach there you are going to log on on this key using this key it takes you to the login page but i'm not going to log in there let me go direct to the e-learning platform in order to get to the e-learning platform this is the url you are going to put in you are going to say mudo dot ucu dot sc dot ug and it will lead you direct to the e-learning platform if you don't want to pass through the website so there are two ways you either go to the website which leads you to the e-learning platform or you go to direct to moodle our e-learning platform and you will be there let me show you how to what you use in order to log in you need what we call login details and it is going to ask you for the username for those of you that are continuing students you already know that you have to use your access number at students.ucu.sc.g that one is your that one is your username you put your access number at students.ucu.sc.g and actually that is your ucu email address and then the password for the continuing students you have your passwords already you submitted them during registration for the new students you are going to get that done with time what i request you that now for now before you get your login details you are going to log in our platform as a guest so after you have logged on let me do let me log out here and then log in so that you know you use your login details and i'm going to use mine you put in your password and then you login so if you don't have login details you can still log in as a guest so that but remember a guest cannot really get involved in the work so i advise that those of you that don't have login details you find a way of getting them especially with the continuing students the new students we are going to take care of that and we are going to send you those details so i'm going to log on to my platform and when you reach to your platform there are many ways of reaching towards to what course you have as you can see it has this platform high three columns it has this column that takes you to the administrative thing it shows you your courses the moment you will log on to your courses is the courses you are going to be down here and then it also shows you this part where it shows you the faculties where you belong if you belong the main campus or whether you belong to kampala campus or to the different faculties for now we are all going to belong to one of these the faculties and schools and we are going to go to the e-learning odl competence course because that is what we want to navigate through that is what the course that is going to help us understand how to use the e-learning platform how to access our course units how to submit our assignments as you can see it has some descriptions here it has it it says it's this is a course that introduces you to the use of the elan platform so the moment you get to this course you are going to just click on it those of you that are students already continuing students it is going to ask you for an enrollment key and that key is o d l that is o d l capital letters just like here o d l so the moment you put in that as an environment key you are going to get to this particular window the ones that don't have logon details for now i request that when it comes you just click on guests you log in as a guest unfortunately the guest just looks they are not able to engage in the activities so this course has some text it actually takes you through all the process that is going to help you get to your course units access whatever you want to access for example the first part here is telling you let us click here to introduce ourselves so when you click here you are going to engage you are going to introduce yourself and as you introduce yourself you are going to learn how to use a discussion forum because this is a discussion and the discussion forum is one of the forums we use to especially for groups to be able to discuss topics that that lecturers will give you also another forum is here click here to tell us some of your expectations as an online learner the moment you click here it's going to bring you something like this and then you start you start you click here and then you start telling us what the topic is you are going to reply and then for example if i replied here then i can start writing and then i submit that means you have submitted your reply on on the discussion so when you go on to this course now it says the different modules we have arranged this course in in form of modules depending on what you need to learn as an online learner what do you need to know the first part actually helps you to navigate through the learning management system this particular system how do i navigate how do i update my profile a profile means that you are going to put your names there you are going to put all your dots like your hobbies things like that you are going to put your picture so how do i do this it takes you through all this and then it also takes you through how do i access the course content there are different ways because we we are trying to reach out to the different learners some people learn by maybe watching a movie or a video so you click here you are going to play this video and it's going to take you through all this but other people learn by reading that different manuals so we have put some manuals here in form of pdf file files that are going to help you so when you click on this manual it's going to open all that description is going to tell you how to navigate how to edit so you just click on the manual that you want and then it will download and then you read and then you are able to understand that if i go on my platform this is how i'm going to access my courses then it's also ucu has a cloud file storage it's going to teach you how dry use cloud to store my files because some files are very big they may not be on your desktop maybe your desktop does not have enough space you have cloud you see you have taken care of that so this one is going to teach you to help you understand how do i use my clouds file storage okay then you can move to module two module two is all about how to access course content because this is the most important module by the way you are going to be studying online so you need to know what type of content am i going to get so this module takes you through tells you that you get content in form of files in form of videos in form of what we call a model book it tells you how some of your computers may not have the software and may you may need some software in order to be able to download some of the files that will be given to you by your lecturers it helps you to understand the type of content that is going to be used like i said it also tells us how to do this in different formats like there is a video already recorded so for those of you that feel they need to listen in order to learn how to do things we have taken care of that is you just click here and you play the video and then we have also written down this one shows you the different types of files the kind of files that your lectures can use to give you content the audio file the audio file what is it in order to know what an audio file is you are going to click on it and it is going to play image file what i what is an image file it is going to you are going to click on it so basically you just click and then you learn and then if you don't know what a pdf file is it's right here you just click and open it so i have opened some of these ones and for example pdf file looks like this i have opened it so it shows you but but also has some information which you can read and it also will help you so there are different ways of doing this and if you want to know what is a powerpoint file i know most of you know but some people don't even know what a powerpoint file is so that's why we have put all these files here for you to know so if my lecturer give gives me content in a powerpoint file how does it look like it is right here so we have put all this for you to understand and to know that if my lecturer puts something and the icon is this this is an audio file if the icon looks like this this is an image file so we have taken care of all this that is in our module 2 of this course then we also have we are going to have some what we call live classrooms and those ones will be carried out on what we call big blue button so you are going most of your lecturers are going to have live sessions with you and they will be telling you i have created a live session on big bro button this is how it looks like and what you do just click on it if you see let me just go back here and show you again because this is very very important when your lecturer gives you information that they have created a live classroom it is going to look like this it has actually as it says big blue button this blue and it's right here example of a live classroom so what you do you just click on it and when you click when you come here you join the session and then you follow instructions your lecturer will be able to teach you like just like zoom those of you that have been on our orientation you have been on zoom so this big blue button works exactly like zoom it's a different type of zoom so that one is very important you need to know and to learn how to use it and as we have been doing we have another video this video is not very different from what we have been what you should use what you saw when i was just beginning because it also takes you through what all this other information is saying so if you feel you just want to listen to a video you can still click here and and listen to this it will help you to understand how do i navigate how do i log on how do i access my content then module three helps you to understand because when you are doing online learning it's not like face-to-face you need to have some kind of collaboration and communication tools and this is what module 3 is going to tell us it is going to show us how do i use a chat room and what is the chat room by the way and also it's going to tell to help us understand what's a discussion forum just as i began i when i was beginning this i showed you here these are the discussion forums so when you when you click here and you introduce yourself you have already learned how to engage in a discussion and this part also is going to show you how to engage in a chat room a chat room is just like you use whatsapp but this is completely academic so you are not going to go to the chat room for your class or your course and you start putting their things that are not academic but it works exactly like it works exactly like whatsapp you click on it and then you are going to click here to enter the chat just like i have done and then you start answering you can maybe say hello or you ask your questions normally chat rooms are for asking questions and engaging with you with your lecturer so this one is going to teach you how to do that then module we have gone through module three it has those two communication tools module four text us on how to submit assignments this is very very important you are going to be getting online assignments as you know university you have to do coursework assignments so this is this module is going to teach you on how do i access my assignments how do i submit my assignment answers and how do i take a quiz those of you that have done multiple choice questions normally know what a quiz is it's normal in form of multiple choice but it also can be in form of an essay or in form of short answers so you just have to know this what you do you just click on this you open it and it's going to help you you are going to read and understand how do i if you want to read and we have set it up in a way that you are going to actually engage in an assignment and the moment you engage in this assignment that means you have learnt how to do an assignment so i encourage all of you that are going to log on this to please take this assignment that one is going to show us that this student has actually learned how to submit the assignment and is comfortable when the lecturers give you assignments you will be able to submit them so this is assignment is for real you need to take it you need to log in and take this assignment and the the instructions are here so you read them because even your lecturers are going to be giving you instructions so you need to read them and follow them because if you don't you are going to lose max so that is an assignment we are going also to put a quiz we have not put it there this is like uh in form of uh a nessa type of assignment but we are going to put our quiz like for multiple choice to to make you have a feel of how do i attempt these online assignments and quizzes and that kind of thing so module five is actually theoretical it's going to take us through learner-centered education because actually e-learning is about you the lana not much of the facilitator the facilitator is there to help you it's all about you so this module is going to help us understand what's my role as a learner so i encourage you to go through this mod module to read and then you can ask questions because we are going to under this module we are going to create a question and answer chat or discussion so that you help us to understand whether you after reading this you have understood or you need some clarification module 7 is about of course assessment for multiverses and summative assessment it is also something that is going to show you how they are going to assess you as an online learner and under this module we have put a resource which we call a link because many of your lecturers are going to say are going to give you links to different websites so that you can be able to learn to read and learn to create that culture of reading so this is one of them so it takes you to a website that is going to help you read more on about online assessment as you can see you just click on it and then it takes you to where you want to go where it directs you so that is that module module 7 and module 4 is trying to help us understand what is required of me as an online learner qualities of an online learner what am i supposed to do as where do i get my motivation how do i keep my time because you can be at home and you think you are not supposed to read as an online learner you are not in class so you are going to be in the kitchen you are going to be everywhere no but this module help helps us to understand how am i going to be a good online nana so that i don't drop out of my school so you are going to read this and we are going to include some question and answer and also discussion forum so that we can be able to discuss especially if you have questions about this because this training is actually self-test you are going to be there and do it yourself you are going to go through this yourself and you are going to learn how to use the learning platform down here you have most of the resources that you need like how self motivation and online learning so what you do you just click on this you open it and then you read how where do you get that self motivation as an online learner so all this is part of learning and then also we have that part of frequently asked questions there are very many questions that everybody asks how do i do this how do i log on so they are all under here and we are going to continuously develop this to make sure that we help you learn and have a comfortable feel of online learning so with this i think i've tried to navigate through and as as i as i said before you can click here

class the mobile of course you don't call outside working hours but you can also use that so you can always contact us we are going to be here to help you and with that i thank you so much for listening to me and i wish you all a very fruitful time at uganda christian university thank you so much
come to this tutorial that will give you an idea of how your rasaan University aligning portal will look like as a student the first thing for you to do in order to access your sango elearning portal is for you to to type in the website for asan University which is w-w-w dot RI o dot edu tatsurion that will lead you to this the homepage for the university you want to come to the menu option which says portal right here and then you select the e-learning portal instead of the student management system portal so you are going to click on eLearning and then the e-learning rasam University learning portal is going to open and it will look something like this in the top right corner is where the login button is you click there and then it will lead you to the login page you will be given a username and a password for you to use in order to access your portal once you have put in your password I already have my password and I have saved it I clicked on remember username and the password so my computer already has my password once you type in your password here you will simply click on login that should lead you to your photo so this is how the Rahsaan University in learning portal looks like it leads you straight to what is called your dashboard on this particular dashboard it's basically like your home page where you can see all the information about the courses that you are in rode in if I scroll down you see that these are the causes that I would have been enrolled in as a as a student the causes appear in this particular corner right here and if you see here we have three options there is in progress this future and there is past the one that says in progress are the causes that you would have been doing in that particular session if you enrolled for any other course that will be in the future it will appear there and then anything else that you would have done in the past will appear under this particular pattern and so at this time there is another important button that you need to know which is the timeline right here and I'm going to click on it this particular Timeline view allows me to see the pending tasks which ahead of me for example from one of the causes in the next 30 days I can see already here that there are some assignments that will be pending so your timeline gives you an idea of what is coming ahead assignments quizzes discussions and so forth in order for you to see your courses you need to click on this button here and then you have your view again I'm going to click on one of the causes where I have been enrolled in as a student in order to show you how it will look like so I have clicked on the course theories of personality when I click on the course it opens up like this and right here I am welcomed to the course and I can see the course outline if I click on this particular icon or link it will lead me to the course outline and I can simply download it and save it on my laptop on my computer I have clicked back to come back to the course and I can see all the topics which are lined up by the lecturer and the notes are given under each particular topic sometimes you even have video links if they are in assignments they will appear under here for each and every topic like if I lead you down here you can see on topic number 10 BF Skinner's theory of personality there is an assignment that will be due when that topic comes up and also finally a course project so the best practice is to download your lecture notes and then save them in a folder so that you can always get to them once you are offline on the right side of the screen I can which is this area here I can also see the outline of the course they welcome the topics all of them are also displayed in this particular side of the screen and then also down here I can see also the other two courses in which I am in wrote in and so this is how my home page will look like and once I have clicked on a course it will appear like this I want now to show you how you can also see the other classmates that you may have right here on the right side there is participants if I click there it will lead me to the screen way I can see any other students that would been in wrote in the class including my teacher who in in this case is dr. Yasmeen sultanim Hindu apart from the participants if the lecturer has permitted his settings for me to see the grades I can also see the grades according to the assignments and quizzes and whatever activities are lined up from this end I will click on back so that I can come back to this particular page on the top menu and this course which is right here you will see that there is a drop-down menu that comes I can also click on people and that will bring me to the same page where I can see my other classmates who have been enrolled in this particular course if I go back there to this menu I will see if I click on the assignments it will bring me all the assignments data for that course and if I go back again and click on resources you can see that all the resources that the lecture has provided for this particular course we will be shown on this particular screen I want to go back to the dashboard and that is very easy for you to do there are two ways the first is for you to click on dashboard which is right here and that will bring you back to where you started from your homepage kind of another way is for you to go to this menu option right here which will bring a dog down menu and you can see also that this dashboard there that brings you back to your dashboard where you may want to see the rest of you of your cousin's in the top right corner which is right here in the top right corner you you have preferences where you can edit your profile for example you want to upload a picture of yourself this is where you come to and that is very easy for you to do you simply select click on image right here insert an image once you do that it will lead you to where you can where you saved the image you would like to upload you choose the file and then you insert it accordingly to the place way it is saved on your on your computer and then you open it and then you upload that file and then you update that profile so you will have a picture then that will appear with your name another thing that is important is perhaps if you want to change your password this is the place where you come to for the other things I advise that you leave the settings at default until you are more familiar with the system but you could change your password you could also edit your profile including uploading a picture of yourself once you are done with whatever you wanted to do on your portal and you want to end your session before I do that I just want to go back right here you can always navigate from one course to another from the dashboard from the dashboard on this end or you could go up here and you see the courses where you would have been in road and then you simply click on it that will lead you to the other course that you are interested to to see once you are done with I wanted to do it is important for you to remember that you need to log out you simply come to the top right corner which is right here and among the options you will see at the end right there is the option for you to log out from your session that is all is important for you to do that you do not forget to log out from your portal just in case your child or any other person does anything on your portal without your authorization so thank you very much this is how you get into your portal and how it looks like
 we're just waiting for the stream to reflect okay  foreign   hello and welcome to the sports webinar on how to make your school a digital Rockstar now you'll notice that I am alone I'm not actually I have Michael on the line we're going to talk through all of the slides that he has prepared and he was in a little earlier to talk through the model lessons that he's brought in so you're going to see that pre-recording as well do remember that you can talk to us Dylan is watching the Twitter feed it's hashtag VA webinars so that's V for Via a for Africa VA webinars tweet us over there as well as in that chat box just below the live streaming window okay so without further Ado I'm not going to hug the camera for myself we're going to go to the slides and we're going to say hello to Michael welcome Michael oh well thank you how are you I am excellent thank you so where are you at the moment I am exactly halfway between bochum Village and Old Lang Syne Village in Limpopo exactly I don't think most people would ever figure out where it is but nonetheless that's where I'm sitting on the side of the road and I think what we have the opportunity is to see exactly how far we can push technology and learning so you really are out there in the field doing this kind of thing that's it that's fantastic well um I don't know if you've got if you've gone front of you but the one I'm looking at at the moment is what's up today and the first points are fantastic well I'm going to read through them quickly so that everyone has general idea of what we're doing and then we can start commenting on them so the first one says a TPAC recap then a little bit more about pedagogy TPAC in a foundation based classroom TPAC in an ebook listen tpacking an assessment lesson and what's next so great we're going to start with the TPAC recap then yeah I think everybody remembers exactly what tpec was and it's not on the screen I think and we spoke in the first session about the fact that teachers are experts at choosing content and making sure that they choose the right content they also have good training in how to teach which is the pedagogy and for the last two sessions we've been focusing on the technology aspect now we've said that in the TPAC model what we're looking at is that intersection right in the middle where all three of those sets intersect and that's the so-called sweet spot or where really good learning or e-learning takes place okay and we also said that the Sweet Spot doesn't happen throughout the whole lesson often it will go in between different sections and there'll be moments where the sweet spot where everything just comes together didn't we yeah and I think as as as all of our skills improve as the technology improves we're going to find that that sweet Sports becomes the whole lesson eventually and it came to be a complete transformation of learning yes but until we get there I think it's important that we keep striving to work in that sweet spot and not think oh well if we can't have perfect e-learning then there's no point I think it's just got to be sure that we're doing good learning that you've touched on something very important there the the aspect of growth as a teacher as educationists everyone we're all growing in this industry together and we're all trying to find that sweet spot and make it work for a longer period of time and it is no one's going to have the exact right answer at this point yeah well we have spoken about pedagogy people and I know the next slide says a little bit more about pedagogy remember it's the how we teach that's right have you you probably remember when you were back with you doing your diploma in education or your the Ed there was a whole section dealing with pedagogy and didactics and that's really what we're talking about now and I thought what would be useful is if we just skimmed through some of the pedagogical strategies that teachers use in class because the fact is that the same pedagogical strategies are equally relevant when it comes to e-learning yes Well we'd have spoken about this as well and we say that most of the pedagogy that we use whether with technology or without technology has actually been around for a really long time sometimes we just develop the names for them once we we use it more often but that strategy has always been there and what's exciting about the use of technology is that it makes certain types of pedagogy more accessible that's it okay so I've got the direct instruction slide in front of me at the moment and I'll read through the points before we choose one or two to discuss the first point is lecture then explicit teaching drill and practice compare and contrast didactic questions demonstrations guided and shared reading listening viewing thinking right I think direct instruction is exactly what's happening in any classroom where you have the teacher who's providing the input and it's exactly direct instruction and I think from most teachers days you can think back to the lectures that we had at University and that was exactly what it was now obviously we know that direct instruction cannot be the only pedagogical strategy that a teacher takes on otherwise lessons are going to become completely boring they're not going to be able to engage their Learners so direct instruction needs to form a part of any good learning that it won't necessarily be the sole part of the learning I completely agree that direct instruction does have a definite role to play with in the classroom and and there's some things that just do work very well when you use direct instruction I think a lot of maths can be taught very well with direct instruction not all mats there's some things that are good to discover as opposed to be told but it tests you your pedagogy has to suit your content that's it I mean on that list you'll see drill in practice which has sort of become a bit of a bad word you know we don't want Learners doing things by route but the truth is is that when you're looking at things in mathematics like number bonds or things in a language like spelling then there has to be role and practice in order to master the content the exciting thing about e-learning is that the drill in practice moves away from just that sort of mindless task and by using games in e-learning for example so you can have the number bonds on the screen and the Learners got to shoot them out of the sky or some other thing suddenly what used to be a very boring pointless activity becomes a very engaging fun task and learner is able to develop the Mastery of the number bonds or spelling or whatever very quickly and they don't even notice what's happening yes and in terms of preparing this drill and practice worksheets it's a lot more fun to give an app or a piece of software that they can practice on rather than making hundreds of worksheets with two plus three two plus four two plus five monotonous yes you can use your creativity as a teacher in other areas then that's right now the kids can do it by themselves individually and and that means that they can work at the pace that's going to suit them best yes that's perfect and that they can then opt to do more if they need to do more and it provides this Avenue of self-monitoring or oh yes all of that okay and now you've also got didactic questions over there what do you mean by those questions are literally teaching questions and they're very powerful because asking didactic questions the teachers able to assist the level of understanding the level of comprehension and the level of knowledge that the learner has so we're looking at questions like what how when where so they're very closed questions they have this very specific answer now in a very large class it can become almost impossible to figure out if each learner is able to answer each of those questions but using things like social media email what you can do is you can send out the questions to all the Learners they can reply as a teacher you can skim through check to see exactly who has a grasp of the concept who doesn't and work with them so very powerful to use those sorts of questions yes I think so shall we move to the next slide instructional skills yeah okay so we have explaining demonstrating questioning questioning technique wait time and levels of questions and of course levels of questions talks to your balloon's taxonomy that's right okay what is wait time though right time is is something that as teachers we find I think very difficult to work with research is shown that in order for somebody to access something from long-term memory that they've learned takes three to five seconds now what we often do in the classes we'll ask a question expecting the Learners to be able to answer instantly and the truth is is they're actually going to have to take those couple of seconds to process and then retrieve from long-term memory so wait time is about just asking a question uh Michael we're losing you you're going quite Softly can you hear me better now oh perfect so wait time is about waiting for them to be able to respond better because I need to they need the three to five seconds to retreat from long-term memory the information that you're asking for that makes sense okay but I'm going to move on to the next slide which is experiential learning and we've got field trips narratives conducting experiments simulations games storytelling focused Imaging field observations role playing model building and surveys yeah all of this is about learning through an experience a real experience and although I must when I say real if you look at something like focused Imaging what you're talking about there is leading the Learners through a situation where they are thinking about what it would be like for example to lie on the grass outside how what what do they feel what do they hear what do they see now that's that's sort of focused Imaging is going to allow them to write a piece of a paragraph for example in the language lesson so but the point is is that although they may not physically experienced that they've experienced the sensations and that's what this is about and we learn very partly when we experience what it is that we need to learn it would be quite an interesting activity to do using technology of some sort if you were to be able to provide the scene within well let's say talking about the Diary of Anne Frank would you be able to use technology to do focused Imaging within that or is it more about imagination I think it's more about imagination but I think technology does help for example is that you as a teacher sitting out in the middle of nowhere and you were doing the Diary of Anne Frank you'd be able to use technology to find footage for example on YouTube that would show exactly what Amsterdam looks like so that you the Learners can understand what it's meant to be living in that attic and in that way they'd be able to experience albeit at a at the start removed but there's that experiential learning of it otherwise it's just oh there's this girl living in an attic but without truly understanding it okay and that kind of activity is rude it is augmenting your your lesson by doing that okay well I'm going to move on to independent study where we have essays computer assisted instruction journals learning logs reports learning activity packages correspondence lessons learning contracts homework research projects assigned questions and Learning Centers yeah okay and learning log okay well do you remember in the Star Trek um captains log four five six three or whatever it was and what what was required as a captain is that they log every element of of their journey and in the same way a learning log is about the learner making notes about what was learned now the difference for me between a journal and a learning log is that there's an element of reflection that's interested within a journal and the learner will think about what it is that they um learned they will be able to comment on it whereas a learning log is simply this is what I learned today this is what I understood this is where I have a problem and it's just a formal factual way that you can actually follow up with the learner to see what their progress is like Journal especially I suppose with my subject maths and to incorporate feelings into meds isn't a no-go you don't do that because then it incorporates their self-esteem as well and that's just the end of their maths thing you've got to just tackle the knowledge and so if they're able to write down or record that um this is a section that they need to revise more without saying oh I feel so stupid I can't believe I can't do this it just helps later on when they go back and they look so that they don't feel stupid they just go okay I need to revise it again that's right so so yeah I mean I think um particularly in The Sciences the whole idea of the learning log seems to fit more clearly than it would be in the content subjects perhaps but I think with with careful use one could find exactly the way to use it yes I like that homework is there as an independent study I think too often we just take home at homework for granted and it's actually a really important skill to be able to manage your time while no one else is watching you and to find the answer when you don't have a person who's standing in front of you who has all of the answers I mean a lot of e-learning I think is about making sure that Learners develop the key 21st century skills that they're going to need to be able to thrive during school time and post school and being an independent worker is going to become more and more important for them so if they're able to develop those skills by doing things like herrenberg I think it's a perfect start for them yes completely agree I'm moving on to the next slide which is indirect instruction so we've got problem solving case studies reading for meaning inquiry reflexive discussion writing to inform concept formation concept mapping concept attainment and close procedure Michael my favorite thing I think of all time is concept mapping and I'm not even joking I would rather sit down and draw up a concept map than watch a movie it really makes me exciting excited how content all links together and it makes this beautiful picture instructions is that the instruction is given and then the learning takes place indirectly where the Learners are participating in their own work being able to to work with it and yeah concept mapping I think is a very useful tool to use maps are Concepts and they don't understand it's a beautiful way to do indirect instruction and I see you've got reflective discussion over here as well so I think I'm leaning a lot in my teaching techniques towards indirect instruction because reflective discussion is also one of my favorite things the ability to sit down and reflect on a piece of work but within a con conversation rather than writing it down in a journal yeah love it and I think what it does in many ways is when it's the effective discussion with the learner and the teacher or the Learners and teacher is that it levels a playing field because the learner's able to see the teachers vulnerabilities and the teachers able to see the Learners vulnerabilities in terms of what what went well then what didn't go well and it means that it creates a much more open more fluid learning space for the Learners to operate in so it's very powerful for me and I think also reflection is a difficult thing and we sometimes expect our Learners to reflect and we haven't given them enough training in it and reflective discussions are a wonderful way for the teacher to Mentor what you do when you reflect yes and working with the Learners to do that and of course you've got to have some terminology to be able to reflect just like we're going through all of these terms now so that we can later analyze videos the Learners also need to have the terminology to explain what they're talking about or to identify a particular skill or concept that's it yeah okay so the next one is interactive instruction and we've got a long list starting with debates role playing panels brainstorming peer partner learning discussion interviewing conferencing problem solving structured controversy laboratory groups tutorial groups Cooperative learning groups think pair share and jigsaw now tell us about jigsaw ways of working with Learners and what it does is it creates accountability and what it involves is working with the whole class where there's either a set of questions that have to be answered maybe on a text in language class or there's research to be done perhaps in one of the content subjects and what the teacher would do is let's just say for example she has five key questions or five key areas she divides the class into five groups and each group gets a task or a question or a section of the work that they have to focus on and become experts on each member of the group is given a number one two three four five or whatever and there's as many as they are in the group after the period of time in which the Learners have completed the task all the number ones from each of the groups get together all the number twos all the number threes Etc and they then have to share their knowledge their learning with the other members of the group now how this works effectively is that that we all know that you often learn best by teaching so first of all I've had to Grapple with the concept in my first group and now I go into the second group and I have to share that knowledge I have to teach it to to my peers and that reinforces the learning for the learners what it also does is it holds them accountable often we are concerned that group work is a lot about some people participating other others not if you know you're going to go and sit in another group where you're going to be the only person who can answer that question or share that knowledge it means that you're going to take your group work in the in the first group far more seriously so that you're able to learn more so it's a very effective way of engaging the learners okay so if I understand you correctly the let's say the four topics are ants butterflies bees and cockroaches so there'd be four groups formed maybe with 10 people in each one of those groups and the one group will talk only about the ants the other about the bees butterflies and cockroaches and then after a set amount of time those groups would be divided or the members in the ants group would each be given a number from one to ten and then would form a new group all the ones one from Ant one from B one from butterfly one from cockroach would come together and they would teach each other about their insects that's it well it creates a nice accountability then they've got to be accountable all the time they've spent with the first group and be and be accountable to the others that they explain things well without simplifying unnecessarily you know as teachers sometimes we can do that as well where we cut out important information in order to make the explanation simple but it is a skill to say enough that's right yes okay well with that Michael we're going to move on to the recording of going through the foundation-based classroom and you were here this morning for that recording so Dylan's going to swap it across but before we do that I'm going to say goodbye and thank you very much I've enjoyed the last four weeks thoroughly well thank you very much it's been great being able to taste ideas and have a skeptic to work with so that I could be forced to think really hard about what I was trying to convince people about so thank you for your work and thank you for doing and I hope everybody's enjoyed the webinars as much as we have yes I hope so too we'll chat soon and it's great thank you to go over to the recording now great Cheerio then bye okay thank you very much for staying with us Dylan is going to pull up the recording from earlier on this morning and while he does that I am going to take off these earphones because it feels a little like I'm talking underwater and we will be watching the Twitter feed still and remember it's hashtag VA webinars and we'll be watching the chat box so keep the comments coming in what's nice now though is that I'll be able to join in those conversations as well so watch out for me come say hello and it's always difficult watching yourself isn't it and Dylan's going to bring across the recording now thank you Dylan hello Michael welcome thank you Helen now we're going to talk about a foundation phase lesson that's been recorded where is the school that it's been recorded in the school soccer zani Primary School okay stat which is about a two-hour drive to the east of nelspruit yeah very rural School um about 600 kids grade or to six a very committed group of teachers who have taken on e-learning in a big way VIA Africa introduced what we call a via Africa digital education center at the school when you watch the video the opening shots are of what the digital education center looks like and inside at our books as well as 15 tablets which we've put our e-learning materials on for use by the teachers and learners okay so you have put the center into their school how have the teachers accepted it it's been a fascinating Journey for us there's only been there since May I said very recently very recent so it's they've basically been working with the materials for about a term and a half okay and one of the teachers told me that technology came after she was born and she had been quite anxious about using it yes but part of our putting these digital education centers in is a commitment to training because we believe that the only way things are going to be able to change with e-learning is if teachers feel comfortable and competent so we go in every two weeks we do teacher training with the teachers using the different software on the on the devices so that they can develop the skills and the knowledge and I think when you see the videos you're going to see teachers who are very new to e-learning yeah that you have an incredible amount of confidence that's good they've been very exciting so yeah we haven't had any negative or I don't want to do this in another one of our schools one of the teachers said when the first training was going to happen she was too scared to go in a shame and then she went in and now she can't believe how exciting it is to be able to use tablets in a classroom so so they're tablets they're tablets yeah and they've got all your content on it ebooks as well as our educational apps as well as access to the internet they get free Wi-Fi from us so that they can develop lessons that work in YouTube Google Maps Etc oh fantastic okay well the first lesson is a foundation based class I think they're grade twos aren't they that's it yes and let's take a look at the TPAC Venn diagram we have for the class okay so if we can go back to the beginning we spoke at the very first session about content and technology and pedagogy and in the last two sessions we've spoken a lot about technology so this is a nice way of bringing it all together and if anybody's forgotten where they're aiming for is that triangle right in the middle where all three spots The Sweet Spot we all intersect so what we're going to look at is it's a the content is developing perceptual skills and language okay and the technology is using a tablets and using the Via Africa app Play and Learn okay now just a little bit more about this class they only make the switch to English in grade four so these are Learners who are siswati speaking and all the teaching is done in siswati with just the English first additional language components being taught to them this app they're working with is in English and you're going to see the instruction takes place in English with a little bit of code switching where it's necessary okay and just to watch the language development of these kids has been incredible as they've just engaged in learning the vocab so with the use of Technology they are they don't necessarily have to have it in their own language they're able to use it anyway if if it's well mediated and I think when we watch the video you'll exactly see the mediation from the teacher well shall we take a look stick Dylan will you put the video up for us please bring it up fantastic okay he goes okay  [Applause]  [Applause]  good morning Kratos  today we are going to learn on Play and Learn touch it then it appears on the screen English you click English it appears the white line in between you touch the white line and you write your name if you are done with your name you click enter there is something that is appearing there at beds flying you touch the screen you wave it on the left and beside the screen Saga left you click language then you click the white line then it appears easy medium hard you click hard media easy sorry click easy then you listen to the to the voice day  [Applause] then you carry on like that if you don't if you didn't listen carefully you go to the left hand side on the top Corner you're gonna get a volume there yes you must click and they repeat the again the question  so excellent yes you move on to medium oh that's good that's the end of the medium game thank you great tools we must stop thank you for your cooperation thank you for everything you did to us today with the two activities we have done thank you very much  there are so many things about that lesson that I really like and at first when I saw it a week ago I thought but the teacher's just standing there and telling them how to use tablet but when you start thinking of it from a learning point of view and what's actually happening for the learner it's magical because there they are listening to an instruction in English gaining vocab putting pictures into their proper place it's not just an activity where you draw a line This connects with that and that connects with this and it's that kind of activity is very limited because this it just carries on regenerating regenerating and one of the other things I really liked about it is the progression you see the Learners going from easy to medium to hard by themselves before they're even given the instructions that's it they become very attuned to how the app works quite remarkably and then they just go ahead and what's fascinating is that they can do the same thing again and again as we know Young Learners do and they can watch the same video again and again and again but there's always an excitement to it because it's about getting it right and the reward that they get of seeing the right answer yes and give them a great deal of pleasure it's a lot of drill in practice lots of drill and practice if um really in terms of the pedagogy yeah we're looking at computer assisted learning because they're developing vocabulary skills and the computers doing that yes and so it it works and the Learners remain engaged and as you watch the video and obviously these are edited we can't make people sit to 30 minute videos no but you can just see an ongoing engagement with the activity it doesn't flag and the the level of Engagement I mean that classroom or the the area that they're in you can almost feel the engagement as you watch it that's it and what I like about it is you can see that the teachers freed she does the introductory piece and she gets them going some of them are already zipping ahead you're going too slowly and I'll just move along to you and then she's able to go and work with the individual Learners which in a large class she wouldn't be able to easily do yeah and that is very exciting now going back to your TPAC representation of this where the content was perceptual skills and language and then pedagogy was computers assisted instruction and the technology was the tablet and using the app Play and Learn that's it is there anything else you'd like to add to this well she spoke also about the perception and in editing we took out some of the perception so you said we should maybe have a look at it yes because it is I quite like that app so if didn't mention the tablet on screen and see it Okay so we've got the little house of perception and you remember your levels of difficulty we'll start with easy round one of one and here we go what we've got to do is we've got to identify three same pictures and then you just tap them and you just tap them now in terms of perceptual skills being able to recognize that I see three of something and then tapping those three it's quite an important skill to have in Foundation phase but this kind of activity is almost impossible to do with a group of 30 using just paper and or textbooks or things like that you could do it where they just circle it almost like a word search but with this it's speed it's engagement it's constantly looking I think I've lost you though yeah I was ready to finish I could comment yeah yes I mean obviously all the all the perceptual skills will be about the differentiation of the of the of the pictures so we're developing visual literacy skills um the actual coordination of being able to touch touch the correct things we forget that at this level that's exactly what they're doing but you're at if you were to create the same number of cards in a classroom situation you'd have thousands of pieces of paper yeah learning just puts it there and as you saw gets you completely engaged yes I'll stop now um put it away awesome things that you need to do with your hand you need to be able to write and things like that and using technology in the classroom and using e-learning doesn't take away from those activities I think that's a big fear with teachers is if I start doing this then never going to learn to write properly they're always going to have untidy handwriting yeah it's e-learning is one element that you can bring into a classroom and I always believe that if you can do it better with pen and paper or if you can do better with teacher standing in front of the class do it yeah you can do better using the technology then do it so drill in practice for example to get the number of worksheets you'd require for the kid to be able to do the number of number bonds for example that are required is unbelievable yes and it becomes very boring very quickly yes whereas you take the same concept number bonds you put it into a computer game you the kid has to touch the screen to identify the answers or shoot things out of the sky or whatever the game is is developed as and suddenly you've got an Engaged learner who will sit and learn number bonds for hours and hours yes and when they get the reward if if they always sort of broke up and are ready to do the next round so very purposeful e-learning is what I believe in rather than just so well now suddenly we're going to sit back and let e-learning take over because it doesn't the tool should always suit the job and not the job suiting the tool that's right and I think you've said that the whole way through that's it yeah okay shall we move on to your ebook lesson yeah now um we have our TPAC circles again the content that's being covered is Matt's term one revision so it's my thing maths love mats pedagogy has drawn practice and the technology we're using we're going to discuss after we've watched the video that's it okay well Dylan shall we watch video number two  [Applause]  [Applause]  thank you  good morning learners so we are going to to do a mathematics today so here I think you see the Via Africa mobile yes just press the just president I think now you know what you see yeah just grow to mathematic grade five slowly slowly okay page 18. previously yes because I were going to do a 101 revision you see now is term one revision just just is there that we are going to do just the exercise that you are going to do thank you okay learners you can now go to page 11 for further explanation where you can watch the videos there foreign  D is for division M is for multiplication A is for addition and S is for subtraction so we need to do the part in Brackets first which gives us eight and eight and then 17 minus eight is nine oh  okay Learners just close the exercise because now we are finished so thank you thank you very much foreign  like the fact that the tablets are up on the wall so that they have space to put their books down in the normal classroom if they had a tablet with them they'd have to somehow p
t the tablet on their lap or hold it up here it would be really awkward and I know they've been mounted there for security reasons also keeping the power cables in but I think it works really well it works very nicely and it's because it does free up the space so that you get all the modalities in the learning it's not just the screen as we saw in the first one but actually they can learn and they're using they're using it as a book yes but it's more than that it's more than the replace of that rat model that we keep talking about isn't it okay yeah because I mean if people remember it was replaced or augment or transform and what we have here is the replacement because they go back and they do termine revision yes and they're writing the answers in the book so very much pure replacement textbook but the Learners who can't remember for example how to do bird mess have the opportunity to go and watch a video from book and they they get their own personal revision and that's the augmented and that's the augmentation that's it and that's a really valuable thing because I know teachers we get fed up with it re-explaining the same thing bodmas is a perfect example whether they are in great four or they're in grade 12 you have to revise it over and over and over again that's it so to have that is an augmentation that's what the teacher knows you can go back to page 18. yes and you'll find exactly that yeah yeah and I think it works very nicely because the little boy watches it and he's in intrigued by it and then can go on and do the activity rather than waiting for a teacher who can come and explain yes or getting it wrong and there are some things that videos can do that are difficult to show on paper for instance the highlighting and showing that the brackets are then replaced with another number and so that you're actually meant to and you can see that those brackets are equal to eight it's the same thing same value yeah it's good so if we go back to the tpack in an ebook lesson we'll see that the technology has been filled in and we've got tablets with the Via Africa Mobi reader and ebooks that's it yeah now you've spoken about epubs before versus other things what makes an Epub different okay so ultimately any book that you do on a computer is an ebook ebook Okay and but that would include a PDF now PDFs have been around a long time and they're very static and it's literally like looking at a piece of paper and a glass because that's what you can do you can highlight it yes but that's all you can do and you can zoom in you can zoom in you can zoom out yeah yes so but it doesn't allow you any opportunity for any augmentation so using a PDF you're looking at peer replacement in the red model what an Epub does now epub3 is it allows you to add enhancements so you can start to use video audio and drawing canvases Etc inside the book itself so suddenly you move to the augmentation of watching the video that the little boy is able to see so ePub 3 opens up all those opportunities for more enhanced learning and greater augmentation now you've spoken about before and teachers being able to put their own content within an Epub so if this teacher thoughts that they needed some extra revision or something he'd be able to put something in if you were using a learner management system okay because currently what would happen is just in terms of the way a standalone eBook reader like Moby reader is is that it reads the the books that are contained within it in order to be able to access additional information that we've spoken about you'd use a learner management system which will then attach the correct information of the right space in the book okay and that we spoke about in this learning and systems so people are welcome to go back and watch that to find out more about their owner Management Systems right okay shall we move on to the third one yeah and now oopsie now we don't have anything filled in we've just got t-pack in an assessment lesson we don't know what content is being covered what the pedagogy is all the technology that's it I thought we would do a little bit of pedagogical scaffolding so we've moved out to remove the scaffolding the first one we had all answers then we had a few and now challenging people watching to actually identify the various elements and then we'll talk about it after the video I well let's take a look at video three and then it's going to pull it up for us correct here we go thank you Dylan  [Applause]  [Applause]  good morning grateful today we are going to look at the basic operations and relationship in mathematics when we are talking about the four basic operations in mathematics we are talking about addition suppression multiplication and division when we are talking about the relationship there is a relationship between addition goes with suppressions multiplication caused with division at the end I'm going to take the percentage of the Learners how much each and learner have understand so that it can show us whether they can understand this basic operation and the relationship in mathematics so now the Learners are going to start you test yourself that is exercise number two good mathematics  oh yeah yes that's it start yes very good foreign do your exercise number two yes yes I'm coming yes that is how many percentage of God check your answers review to answers okay two number two yes Yolanda we said yes very good then they just do the free number operation that's good that's good it's going on right okay 88 hey the 12 percent the just try and get that 10 percent so that because next week we are doing the Anne and I say this It prepares ourselves for honor the next the big test that we are going to write next week very very good that is wonderful [Applause]  I must say I really like that tagline that our teachers our future because so often people think that teachers aren't well they're unvaluable and we are very much so and they've probably been part of our Africa's move is that teachers have to be valued because what they're doing is the most critical element of everything that they do yes I love the way that men the teacher I don't know what his name is but it's the way he engages with those Learners while they are doing their self-assessments and you think self-assessment is going to be a very individualized thing and a very lonely thing almost to do and yet theory is watching everyone seeing how they're doing encouraging improvements and that as well that they're retaking the test over and over again that's it that's fantastic I mean what's exciting is that because everyone's working at their own pace it's not the sort of standard well I've got to assess you so I will give you a piece of paper I'll wait for everybody to be finished and then I will mark them and then give it back to you a week later it's instant answers uh they you can work as one learner finishes you can go and see how they did the the test yourself app that they're using that I showed a couple of weeks ago yes what it does is it allows them to go back and look at each wrong answer and look at the memorandum to see exactly what they did wrong and then they can redo the test and it shuffles the questions so it's not about oh I know the answer because question one is four and question two six suddenly question 10 comes first so the ability to to keep doing it it's about practicing because ultimately maths particularly at this level is about the practice uh anyone who knows who teaches maths knows that um you can pretty much give the same test paper to the same class with a weak space in between they won't actually realize that they've written the test before because they don't they don't click that they've seen those things before so you can do the same activity over and over to test the skills or to develop the skills and so there's a lot of Merit in redoing the same assessment over and over and especially the reshuffling because now they know well I am going to see this question again in this case I know I'm going to see this question again why is that one the right answer uh so and they think why is it the right one so that I can remember it is the right one because the question says this and that means it must lead to that answer that's it something that struck me particularly when I I got to watch the video again is it was done a week before the Anna's yes you hear him talking about and then as I've turned into this huge thing and it scares lots of children and there they were practicing and preparing for it in a very relaxed calm way with no anxiety and he had no anxiety as a teacher and I think that says a lot in terms of how the technology has been able to assist yeah yes I love the point at one point he congratulates someone for doing so well that's it and it's a great feeling yeah even just to watch and to be that student yes it's shall we take a look at the TPAC again yes okay so we have contents maths and operations uh pedagogy questions informal assessments and the technology is the tablet the Via Africa test yourself app that's it and the objective of the lesson was to revise they were revising they were doing it at their own pace which meant they had time to tackle a question that was more difficult for them or they could fly through the ones that were easier yeah so the University was taking these scores now what the plan is is that he's getting a sense they were doing purely operations so that the quiz is only on that so he would know exactly how much additional work to assign for which Learners yeah some of those Learners are getting 100 clearly they they're quite compensated number operations but the Learners were getting lower he's going to have to do more remedial work and that's given to him very quickly very instantly and he has the time to engage it doesn't take a few hours to Market test to figure out who's doing well and who isn't that's right it takes a lesson that's it yeah and you can provide the worksheets actually as they're walking out the class they need supplementary work you can just say okay well you get extra here's yours here's yours okay you're free for the day but that's it yeah very exciting it is very exciting okay well that's comes to the end of the videos do you want to discuss what's happening next week well next week I'm not going to be here with you no neither I've enjoyed the four days before well the four sessions with you and with Dylan thank you very much bye Africa is very committed to teacher education and teacher development and people need to watch the space because I think there's some exciting things coming down the line more webinars and yeah keep pushing for e-learning because we believe it has a significant place in South Africa that's going to make a big difference to education yes and completely agree with you I also agree with you that the teachers are the most important in implementing it if you don't have a buy-in from the educator it's never going to work so um and there are exciting offerings out there and you have some very exciting offerings and so go out there and try them out experiment yes good well thank you Michael it's been a pleasure having you thank you very much Ellen and I hope to see you soon indeed we shall I'm sure good thank you thank you bye-bye then bye yeah hello and I am back it's a little strange watching your self but at least it's Lisa sound like this is the end of the four part series I'm sure there'll be more to come we have thoroughly enjoyed ourselves both Dylan and I have had a lot of conversations when Michael has been here and when he hasn't about e-learning and I'm sure you've had just as many interesting conversations as a result of these webinars please join us again we will let you know when the next one is happening it's been a pleasure interacting with you and stay in touch goodbye  thank you  foreign foreign
 as online learning and virtual classrooms become increasingly popular mainly because of the kovid 19 pandemic so are online language trainings with technology it has become easy to learn a new language regardless of geographical boundaries or distances roots academy an online platform is helping nigerians living abroad learn to speak and understand their native languages the platform has digitized the learning process making it interactive with the use of technology-based tools and resources i'm ibo and i was raised in lagos and i did my school in nigeria north and i realized that during my time i realized that a lot of people don't understand their language their native language and particularly people within the diaspora who go out to the country and also they realize that when they get married they go out to try and chase their livelihoods change their careers and all they get married to certain people their children don't understand the language and there's a huge vacuum there's basically there's a huge vacuum in learning the language a lot of people don't understand where they're from all they know is that they have this name so that was what prompted us to go ahead and start initiate this world of them getting people to understand where they're from and know the meaning of their name and the language although schools and educational institutions provide opportunities for most individuals to learn languages the internet and advancement in learning technology has brought the process closer to people what we thought of was that since we have people outside the country and in the country who want it we couldn't obviously go and be reaching out to everyone at the same time so we have to create a platform an online platform that will be accessible to everyone and then we ensure that they can still gain the kind of value and substance in what they want to learn that's the reason we now created a website we create a root academy and online really online so that people can in america and london and canada can understand their native language that was the basis of all this do you know you can learn any nigerian language from the comfort of your home with various learning management systems and virtual classrooms focused on language learning learners can have comprehensive learning experience facilitated by the teaching of an instructor without leaving the comfort of their homes city or country 
 educational technology also known as edit tech is one of the many ways education is being made easier and accessible to everyone it is one of the fastest-growing part of digital technology all over the world and its usefulness courts across every part at tech startups in Nigeria in recent years have also witnessed great growth and we have with us now to discuss this TT at they will see the co-founder of Niger kids welcome to the program thank you yes well let me start by asking you what are some of the you know ways technology is helping to improve education let's begin with that very simple example now waiting your child's school you don't get your report cards your bills that even the newsletters and bulletins and Onaga being sent a copy gets sent online and sent by email sometimes even sent by an SMS so it means that there is more increased productivity with the teachers because they don't have to do mundane things some people are taking constant from all over the world and that's really what EdTech is all about attack is technology in education should be making it more you know enhancing it in two different ways so what I think about having it cost in half but you know I don't have to go there anymore I can do it yeah in my on my bed like Netflix using the best professor in a particular topic oh because I'm using it online and that's me so it's in our life yeah I want you to you know tell us a bit more about the concept and especially here in Nigeria do we do we have the you know infrastructure on which to build sound EdTech facilities girion so really once you have connectivity once you have a device and once you have you know applications and all about that attack you know actually so I'll give it I'll give a simple example I don't want to give from the school so schools are using active so some schools in that classes are talking to other students in other parts of the world that's it EdTech some people are also using virtual reality and then there's some people that are doing causes you know online from different parts of the world well you know the teacher using webinars is here in Lagos I can be Nabu John portico and then person is learning ladies attacks altercation enjoyable it has its challenges of course main challenge being connectivity because for attempt to really you know be full-blown it needs connectivity and broadband connectivity it also needs you know the devices to be more affordable so you can access it with their phones to their laptops to very affordable for the common man constraint when comes infrastructure and the last one I'll say is teacher training so yes people know here about a check for our teachers educated about how to use technology right yeah I want to ask for the parents who are listening to us right now you know some of them might be thinking you mentioned laptops you mentioned phones that wouldn't this be a distraction to the children honestly I would say no well destruction destruction is really about putting you know boundaries so the same thing as with television I mean televisions a book source of news so it visuals a good source of information you can watch documentaries or no television but it can also be a source of instruction so using all these things you know I'll take your can't wait to be we don't do baby with the bathwater if I want to find information right now I'll go online you know and others using technology is a destruction well if I'm meant to be at work and doing my work then it is a destruction but it's being able to put the constraint to be able to put the boundaries I can learn almost anything right now you know but using EdTech I can learn how to cook and how to run a business you know using attack so we have various you know some electricians business lab teaching materials about how to run their business it's not a destruction no but if you do it when you're not going to be in there is a destruction your channel has problems you know with maths you can go online to the App Store downloaded you know it must up you can go to Khan Academy for kids are led so it's really you know a wonderful learning true let me give for example you're teaching your child about science you can actually use virtual reality to you know kind of stimulate the experiment without often having to buy all those things so you see the structure it can be but then wanted is in my own mind if you know the boundaries are clearly defined yeah and for every you know sector or industry government policies are actually very important what would it take you to you know put the right policies in place I think number one would be don't really needs to help promote the building of infrastructure that is really what it is you know just the way we have you know good rules to connect also different parts of the country and government is spending money on doing that and you don't need that same amount of energy and focus to connectivity because that is really one of the major challenges of active it's based on connectivity and others are very connectivity broadband connectivity I think so we need to please I'm driving those connectivity because what we do have that then a lot of things can also happen I mean even education to the public sector when you look at public school education if they have you know broadband then access to quality content quality teachers then become you know very simple the other things that they need to have policies would get it up horrible devices so devices from smartphones laptops to computers I think only 7% of Nigerians have tablets and computers so that means is only a privileged few mobile penetration due to smartphone is actually increase in Nigeria you know I think currently by about 25 million people but that's still so small so it means that the government can put policies in place to promote affordable devices that Excel for just you know you know just open up city that they will see but many thanks for joining us 
 [Laughter]  thank you Wendy we will spend the next few minutes uh doing some more classroom applications as we had before and leading this will be um uh someone from our team Howard University Center for African studies that's Dr Helen Bond and she is the associate uh professor of curriculum and instruction in the school of education at Howard University she has a PHD in human development for from Virginia Tech a master's degree in Communications from West Virginia University and a Bachelor's of a science degree in education from the Ohio from Ohio State University she has experience in education and human development in Africa and India Germany Bangladesh and the US she was selected as a full brigh narrow scholar to India in 2012 provided training for teachers in refugee camps along the border of Ethiopia and Somalia in 2013 to 2014 she assisted unicef's West um and central Africa regional office with a post Ebola effort by helping to develop a literacy and numeracy curriculum that would enable youth to catch up on a missed uh education and she also served as an expert for the ministries of Education in Ethiopia and in the United States and the United Nations development program the undp in 2008 to develop a Countrywide teacher licensing system impressive resume please come and now you can guide from here actually that's an older um it is thank you for the introd oh no no worries because actually I'm a full Professor now but that's okay so um I want to take just a few of your minutes and I W to uh I want to do two things I want to introduce you to some additional tools that you can even dig deeper in stories like this as classroom teachers and I want to talk a little bit about how to use secular text I mean sacred text in a secular setting secular classroom so I'd like for you as well as our online audience to go inside and I'm going to be sort of speaking from here so I can make sure I can look at the screen you could go inside your folder and pull out the story organizer as well as our audience online and the cultural representation organizer you know while you're doing that I just had one thought and I wasn't able to ask it when Wendy and dwat was up here I wonder how much we adapt these stories from Modern Day times this notion of disability and caretaking because we know memory historical memory changes over time so that's just a wanted to discuss that but we we lost a little bit of time okay teachers online this is your time especially for the first five to seven minutes you have or should have taken out by now your story organizer and a cultural representation organized um these are commonly call and you know better than I as sort of uh concept Maps story Maps organizers and I'd like to start out by looking at the story organizer and get your ideas on how you might use this but let's take a look at it first the story organizer and and as we were discussing going deeper a little bit about the story I was thinking about that this story organizer would certainly support that effort but how might you those online please feel free to put it in the question and answer uh area of the course or even the chat how might you use this in your classroom to dig deeper we had a really robust discussion in chat I'm imagining in Middle school and high school you may need something a little bit more structured for students certain amount of time and a support sort of a scaffold okay so how might you use this first block says describe the main characters gender age ethnicity class rank do the characters change over time what is the story organizer meant to do by the way I want to give kudos to Brenda for coming up with this redesigning this and I've tried this out in my classroom I want to say that how you use this to really dig deeper to get a better sense what for example what's the story organizer meant to do if you were to use this what are you trying to do yes the kid understand the story better by information okay asking questions about plot stting yes they have to use inference as well as what's directly stated like they can't just go with what the text say as they have Del interpreted okay very good excellent students I think it facilitates critical thinking comprehension like she mentioned just it makes you reflect and contributions to what said St talking about he because is asking about the main the main problem the challenge asking students to summarize maybe they structure some ideas and concept yes um I think thinking of it as kind of a scaffold to get students to the type of discussion that we had um like for example the first question described the main characters like that would help students get to that noticing that it's all women and the time to ask questions about their class or rank just as we did kind of without this question but this PR students to get there directly okay and I'm going to ask someone to look in the Q&A for our online group but what's the overall purpose using concept organizers or story Maps what's the key idea behind that yes we always talk about like how can you help students make their thinking visible because a lot of times they have so many ideas that are rasing around their their head and if you've got some type of thinking frame then they can begin to organize them and see patterns very good so the notion of a concept organizer is to to enable the students to actually see the relationships between the ideas okay we're going to see could you go ahead and read that which one is it oh helping students to pull out the details to help them weave uh together the analysis very good now the next comment is talking about the cultural organizer let's pull up the cultural organizer the story organizer enables students to structure the plot the setting enables them to capture the ideas we have a similar organizer and I do believe that Brenda put this one together it's I think it's very useful well yeah I did that because I I review books and I came up with this as a way of helping me uh really go through the story and what I found was when I use this I often times would totally change my opinion of the book because it really made me you know to dig deeper into the story what is it showing us and and as I would say to people I mean the story organized if you're in English teacher you've probably seen something very similar to that probably the only thing I added to that was like gender or in class I haven't seen you know those necessarily but the cultural organiz the cultural representation was you something different that I created and it just helped me write better reviews now getting kids to use this is will be a challenge because it is lb I can't hardly get the viewers are right for me you know when I'm the editor to do it because it's labor intensive but truly if you as the teacher are doing it I think you will then pull out so many things that you can that are teachable things that you can provide your students because it will be taking you deeper into this culture uh then what may appear on the surface very good I just G to mention that one can use this say the beginning at the beginning of the semester when you're getting to learn the different St that I'm coming in um it can used as an ice breaker in occupational therapy from the healthare perspective we have something called the occupational profile so to speak so all of these facets would be found in there where you interview or speak to a client or a and you're trying to learn about them as a as a person so a lot of these things are actually uh found in the um multi practice framework where it breaks down basic ADLs and you look into that cultural context things of that nature so I could see how this can to address the cultural perspective I might add part of this too is um you know we're trying particularly with the economy and technology which is what they're teaching the six graders they have no concept of what an economy is what is it about so you know you're teaching them goods and services so what we tried to do was to put you know in the find print down here things that related to that topic because we're really in a way kind of teaching them a little Theory here uh in a in in a in in a simpler way uh but to dig into you know what are human resource what are capital resources what and that's in their textbooks but if you're not really teaching it they're really not going to learn it I came up with a game in which I had a a chart and they had to move let's say an ano whether it was a capital resource or it was a commodity because it can be both and we just had toys and we played with them and that way I think they were actually learning okay this is what an economy is these are what the the parts of it are and so that's the theory behind some of these things it's interesting classical teaching incorporates thisas I know very familiar my six grer um and even my current e graduated nth grade these are they come with these things and I'm like oh this NE what is this and step by step actually recreating um the comprehension right recreating the story retelling the story and I can follow just from the the graph the chart but I see this more I don't see it's like a classical teaching as well it might be a frame that borrowed um but I appreciate it it gives me a good understanding of how they're also absorbing the material and how it's being taught um by the school I've as well and I appreciate especially the to one is more the story organiz you'll see you know who are the characters what's the problem although they don't often ask what who who did what to solve the problem that was a part that I kind of add so for for social studies teachers they the cultural one more like the cultural representation organizer is more common sometimes it's called like spice chart or grapes there's different acronyms that are it's not exactly the same but it's it's quite similar so I just think it can be really powerful then for students to see some of these things in multiple classes like I love the idea of using the story organizer which isn't something that I would typically use as a history teacher to help students you know analyze one of these sources from a history perspective so really helpful um and then just a note about the cultural representation um that when I have students do things like sometimes I have them jigsaw the different parts of it so that's one option if this is too much for students you have like a group that's going to look at geography a group that's going to look at economy and then they can share other I just want to keep that off like she's saying uh being a history teacher this would also make a very um a very rich project at the end of the semester or something because there's so much information here and if they're working in groups it facilitates a conversation about the economy geography things like that and then they would really know what they're talking about or what they've learned when this this is demonstrated in the uh project yeah I was about to ask you know in the instructional day or the instructional time the unit plan when you can when can you actually introduce a story organizer or a concept map you can actually do it before instruction what would you use it for prior to instruction prior to reading prior to the lesson you could look for yeah pre-assessment activating prior knowledge you could using during instruction during the pedagogical as a tool to teach but you can also use it as an assessment how might it how might it work as an assessment and then I G to go to part two here yes we actually do an assessment like this like you were saying with the spice chart like my district likes grapes like that's their preferred acronym not as crazy about that one but um you know we do have the kids are are on level sixth graders create posters using an organizer like this and one of the modifications that we do for our students we learning English um as an additional language is that they can use imagery so they don't necessarily have to have the word but if they understand the concept then they're able to like draw or like put together clip art in order to convey it they can do it and it they get so excited they love doing um because they're able to look at it and it really like I know all of this whereas right G was right paragraph It's much harder right I I want to we could say a lot more let me just there are two comments online that I want to knowledge the cultural organizer is a great way to brainstorm with students get students uh involved and engaged in the text uh I teach intensive writing in another language uh so actually the components of the cultural organizer would help students uh produce written piece in other words writing to understand I want to go I I want to move that into just we can here we go back bring here we go just pull this down um just very briefly and I I've heard mention of this this notion of uh working with these sacred texts uh in a uh secular classroom what are some of the considerations if you're talking about these stories talking about these issues in classrooms where there is a supposed clear separation between church and state and religion what are some considerations and then I have some ideas what are some considerations various May repr presented right different groups or different right if you're talking about these or working with these text uh in a secular classroom there is some room for what we call critical engagement of the text the pedagogy promote students independent meaning making and interpretation versus a more religious classroom tends to focus on transmitting religious knowledge with a focus on knowledge and tradition less focus on cultivating uh different interpretations of classical or sacred text I want to follow that up see here click up here here we go another three ways to think about approaching the text from a literary or or reading standpoint reading as the writer reading as the reader and reading as the believer what do you think I mean here by reading as the writer I think we got about five or six minutes left yeah taking into consideration um the trying to see through the lens and perspective of the person that's writing what context their background things of that nature what what is the objective of the the piece that's being read that a trying to spark audience that's reading as the writer which one of these cultural organizers might work well if you're approaching this from doing analysis from Reading as the writer with one of these cultural organizers help in that way if so which one and why use the cultural representation one how much you use that great so we we call what you describe here we call that sourcing um a little bit of close reading but like in my district you know we have students look at the whole context in which the document is made so you're not just looking at what the doc says but like what information would the author have had that they may or may not have explicitly included like what training maybe would they have needed in order to be able to even produce something like this so I think being able to like have students gather all of this information maybe even before they sit down with the text would really help them to be able to pull those pieces back yeah and if you're teaching with primary sources you'll see a lot of overlap here you see the overlap if you're teaching uh with primary sources which is a key social study a key teaching really across uh disciplines there's also reading as the reader identifying the genre purpose of emotional tone of the text uh way of exploring reader own responses again the focus is sort of on the reader identify major plot points and you could actually use the story organizer really in both of these structures reading as the reader as well as the writer asking yourselves how do students view of the situation impact how they feel about what's happened within the story what about the last reading as the believer what's the difference here what's focused on here what's changed if you're going to approach this you're in a more theological lens here you might talk about what a Believer would take from this story what can we say or infer about Believers at the time the story was written how might the story inform a Believer today so there's three different perspectives on which you could approach uh sacred texts from a literary standpoint here very quickly um there's two I i' I've seen this talked about in a lot of different ways uh when you're working uh talking about material in nonsecular environments there's something called what we call transmission pedagogy uh and you see it's very direct form of learning almost didactical a little bit the teacher asked the classic question um calls on students for ansers uh teacher evaluating the students answers and so forth the teacher Prov providing the elaborating on the answer what's the correct answer is a way that um if you're just focusing on what we call transmitting knowledge uh that's a way that uh sometimes this is handled in secular classrooms then there's a more interpretive facilitation pedagogy what we call ifp and it sort of gives a sense uh I'm going to let you look at that and I don't have them side by side but I'm going to ask you as we wrap up what do you see as the difference and I've seen it in many different ways this is very closely actually to the first one but what do you see is the difference between this notion of the transmission pedagogy as a way to work with text sacred text in secular classrooms versus the interpretive facilitation pedagogy student RS a vers or two Teacher Calls the student ask question te repeats the question invites students responses teacher asks follow-up questions to the students responses after students elaborated on the response teacher summarizes it teacher then calls on another student to offer a response to the original question what's the difference between these two and I'm going to wrap up with that even just how they start kind of the idea that the students are the ones that are coming up with the questions they're generating it it's on a teacher generated question is already going to give so many more possible outcomes and there's a lot of different overlays in which you could focus on that one may be more culturally responsive one may be a little less culturally responsive um but it's another way to think about uh as you approach a secular classroom I'm going to I think I flipped out of this but I'd like to see what what's online before I sit down if there's any comments from our online audience we can stop the share I imagine that will enable us okay one last comment from our some students may be deeply invested in their own faith perspectives and may struggle uh with critical engagement that's a really good comment there um um any other questions or or comments one more comment oh one more comment oh my gosh what a long comment here wonderful teaching art history at a secular school I am also surprised how students might not have context so I think it's also important to level the playing field in a secular environment and give context I also discuss uh learning about cultures through a lens of anthropology where all beliefs are valid uh to the origin group and also explain values of the group if a student brings up their own religious uh disagreement this comes up with The Arc of the Covenant in Ethiopia where Jewish students might disagree and we discuss suspending our own belief systems to make a bridge with others let me just ask you as as we wrap up what other concerns I talked about some some practices and strategies in which we can use what other concerns and solutions might we have as we talk about sacred texts not in a religious way not in a way to convert to prize to persuade uh but to inform to teach what other concerns might there be yes do I not concern but possible solution is um when I talk about this from a separate perspective in the tradition now I've talked to um a room full of Orthodox and non-orthodox people and I say up front the veracity of the stories are not in question and the reason why I do this is I think and I I I say it up front I think it's a boring question to ask did these stories take place or not right so when I'm saying this I'm addressing both wordss to the believer I'm telling him we're not here to say these stories didn't happen they're fake they're you know they're not real and to the non-believer I'm not asking him to believe in these stories the veracity of the question we're just not asking that question we're looking at the literature from a literature perspective so for the non-believer you know don't don't believe in it to the believer keep believing in it but it's just again it's not at the center right and I I I found that to be some that is a question of that for the for the audience right the consumer information even having done this um for my own it's so important to understand context in which the conversations are happening once you set the stage I think you can move forward with what your agenda is to get to the ideas or Solutions and kind of outside the box thinking but unless that's done even for the young right Young new the stages set so that everybody's aware where we are and what we're trying to do you'll end up with these kind of everybody be everywhere and it's hard to contain and bring them back to the main agenda so um I love the idea of you must give context right um and in giving context you kind of address almost everyone's um questions that are running through their head um and unless you do that you're may not kind of with another I always said my classes we talk about how the students are the assorted so they have to look at our documents in our sources as histor as a histori look at them and I found that my students that have um personal beliefs they can look at a document um as a historian but then they'll also in our discussion they'll bring up what they know about or what what story or the might mean to them or what they have learned about it in the past and so um but I also thought when Dr beler started today said I'm not you know not looking at as religious you know as a as a religious discussion but as Scholars and and I know I think that also students can hear that and they and understand that what presented inass and to be very clear about your student learning outcomes these are the three things or two things that I want you to learn from this this this this not a matter of Faith but of context and other things by pointing that out okay I think that's it there are no other comments online so thank you very much okay that was so helpful yes um let's do it one minute help us out Y come up we're giving you one minute everyone stand up we do exact we get focus on our legs too stretch even more bend your knees to go little deeper you also open up your arms like this and kind of try to swing the other shoulder a bit open up the hips be careful don't push it and then you can go to the other side and then kind of just stretching your legs and you can kind of open up your  arms and then you can just kind of do this and lean back a little not too much then last one just to open up the shoulders a bit more this breathe in one breath out breathe in  two breathe out breathe in three and exhale thank you morning yeah did I I see what happens yeah so you can share it but it's not on this screen um what we're doing now is doing a demo of the website so if you have a computer um I actually recommend you open it up and go to pm. princeton.edu you can also do it on your phone um and you may if you have any problems biom means tell us I'm often working on my laptop and not checking the mobile view andf so it could be quite helpful if you are um doing that um uh edu so p mm. princeton.edu and it should take you there now um I can always show you hold it up and show you or and was it working before yeah yes do you have another yeah so while we're waiting is everyone got the homepage here power pm. princeton.edu excellent nice it's nice to see the B of you all right so as we've kind of been talking about today this is the Princeton Egyptian no Ethiopian arrian and Egyptian miracles of Mary project um as you can see from the navigation bar we' talked today we we have stories on the website we have paintings of the stories and we have the manuscripts of the stories appearance so these are the three main things that our page is doing and you can go into we have here like featured paintings or featured manuscripts or featured stories and you're welcome to to go and check those out this uh the story that we read today is one of the Ping stories so you can just see it but what I really want you guys to do right now is to click on that navigation bar stories and this takes you to basically a main part of the database where there is uh the list of the Thousand stories you can see up in here it says results thousand and3 records so that's how many stories we have in here um one of the things that was really important to me is that people be able to do research of their own I think you're back thank you thank you um so I'm going to ask you guys to actually uh kind of demo yourself what is going on so for in stories um you'll remember that I was saying that a lot of people said they were just translations so the we have here on the left what's called a filter and this is what allows you to take these thousand stories and restrict it to certain subcategories so if you were working with your students you might say hey um there was a thing that Scholars used to say about the miracle of Mary stories where they were all from France can you give me the answer to that question are they all from France excuse me and then you could go down here and we actually have places of origin on the left it's one of the bottom ones so you kind of have to scroll down if you're in the mobile view there's like a little hamburger with an arrow on it on the top left you have to go there to open up the filter um then you could go in here and you could click on the word France and it would tell you oh yeah they're really true seven stories are from France out of a thousand so clearly France is a huge influence on this tradition right so to me part of it is pedagogical where you can tell the kids hey give me an answer to a question and they can go in and they can kind of um they can prove that so um you might say well actually I'm more interested in Spain and you could do that he's like okay five records clearly not that much or you might say well really what are the ones that are composed in Africa and then you get way up right 817 records are uh from Africa um the reason why it's not as high is because while they're not from Europe there are quite a few stories from the Levant and what that means is from really early this tradition is preserving stories from the 200s and 300s and 400s so if you click on Levant you'll actually get this 22 records or we have this early Christian world because we're like we don't know was it in Jerusalem was it in Syria was it in Egypt we don't know but uh here you got this 88 records and these are the really early stories about Mary they're often in something called the infancy gospel and the Ethiopian tradition is preserving them in G so this is something you can do with students to talk about um the way in which it's it's the most common thing that Scholars do with Ethiopia is to say it's derivative every all the painting is actually byzantin all of the stories are actually French all of the whatever and it's a huge problem in this study so um you may find that in other aspects if you're teaching African studies where people are like oh well you know they only do that because of the British or something so I like this as a pedagogical Point showing to students no there's a lot of originality obviously in Africa um you could also say well I'd like to teach with these stories but I really want to make sure that that has a painting So of the Thousand stories maybe a hundred of them have paintings so you could say well I just want to work on stories that have paintings you could say well I only want this most Illustrated just means things that have the most Illustrated the most painting so that you can do kind of comparative work another thing that you might really want to do is say I only want to see things with the English translation because you're like well what's the point of looking a story where you haven't translated it yet we can't do anything with it as students um the most read in church you know these stories are very old and some of them kept on in the tradition and some of them disappeared even if they were very popular in the beginning so most read in church is kind of a way of talking about the Canon today in Ethiopia what are the stories that you would most likely hear if you were going to church and and hearing these stories right Al this was something that I forgot to say to you all but the these tanum stories are treated as scripture in Ethiopia they are something that are read aloud in church um I also was kind of interested we have done some work on Arabic manuscripts if you wanted to know what were the stories that they didn't move into get is they only appear in Arabic there's very few of them this is not giving you the right response um great that's not correct but um I need to remember that bug there's also you can distinguish here between things that happened during Mary's life like her giving water to a dog in a shoe that's something that she did as a teenager or the stories of things she performed after she died for the people who called on her you could also say I only want to know about stories that are really early like 1300s or 1400s or you could say no I really want to know what have people been writing in the past you know past Century um is there a difference or what kind of concerns do people have now I see that this thing keeps on giving me 622 records so I have some kind ofr I think may hased I haven't oh because we're all on it at the same time yeah okay um it's it's not refreshing sorry you guys all right but you can do stuff here you can also use these um these things to kind of restrict it um you can also do something about popularity or commonness which is how many manuscripts have this story so probably half of our stories appear in only one or two manuscripts so the popular stories um are I don't know something interesting all right so let's okay you've done your research you want then you can go into a story and I'm going to take you into the top story hopefully it's going to let me in here I guess we do have 55 people on the website but really it should not do that it should stay up have everybody get off yeah maybe all right if people want to exit that might help us out I can see it doing its little circle um but what it's going to do is it's going to take us into a page where it's going to give you a lot of information about what manuscript how old the manuscripts are that it first appeared in you may remember that I said that we couldn't tell how old the story was like the cannibal of uh kemer story I'm like was that was that written in the 1900s was that written in the 1700s and it appears in a manuscript from 1400 so we know that it's very very very early all right so this is just to give you kind of a sense for the page I also wanted to make it a page I felt like a lot of pages that are in the digital Humanities that's what this kind of project is called when you're collecting a lot of data about literature that they were very impenetrable like would just give you stats or would only give you tables like the previous page so I wanted to have this where it was written out and more accessible to other people so instead of just giving the date we actually say this story with this short title is very old it appears in manuscripts from 1400 um we also say it's exe extremely common it appears in 71% of our manuscripts that's extremely high this is one of the most 15 most common we also say that it's really Illustrated we have 93 paintings in the database of it this is something that takes place after she died this story actually was composed in Spain one of the very few and what languages then you'll get to a summary you'll get to the actual translation here there's a lot of technical information here mostly for Scholars you can probably ignore it but feel free to explore it and then we also have something where if you want to read a second translation t
e first translation is generally the best but we do have other translations so we're going to provide it and then we give you the citation uh for those of you who are doing historical sources and you want your students to cite your primary sources we give them something they can just copy and and paste into there so this is one way to approach it then if you're looking at paintings um you can go into this and the filter is across the top of the page and you can say well I only want to see things paintings from the 1300s um we have only one at this point or you could say well also the 1400s I want to get a better sense of what's happening in that period um you could also say I'm interested in where the manuscript was from inside of Ethiopia this is pretty scholarly stuff most people aren't going to care about that one thing I use a lot is we definitely have things where we don't have the image we have a description of the image but but not the image itself so you might be like well okay I don't care about don't show me any of those that have no image because I need the image um you can do things where you're like okay actually I just want to see the ones that are in a particular place so you could say well show me only things that are at Princeton or I don't know Library of Congress Etc um the other thing here is that we this pay to be a bit more complicated so these are all the paintings but you can also do paintings by story so if you're doing the paintings by story you could say okay yeah what about that cannibal story you were telling us about belter and then you could do cannibal or whatever and then this will say okay all the paintings that are of this particular story and here are the 94 paintings of this uh particular story we do and I'll show you one more thing here but um so there's that then if you find a painting that you want to look at then you can go into the page and this is giving you again spelled out information about that painting So this painting appears in a manuscript taken that is a nice way of saying looted uh by the British from Ethiopia um and it's dated to the 1600s we have a description of what's happening in each of these things and IDs and so on and whatever the really fascinating thing about this one and I can't zoom in is do you see this character here this is the cannibal depicted as spoilers spoilers okay good all right thank you help us out all right and thing about size whatever good okay so yes you're gonna that's just gonna be very exciting tomorrow Jennica is talking tomorrow and you definitely want to do that and you could also say well I want to view more so there's different ways to go through this all right um I doubt it was going to talk about paintings and I already yeah so you can also go into maps and see um like where in the world these different things are um Howard does have main scripts so you can kind of zoom in here and see where are we is this us I think this is well I don't know anyways so there's the map um the other thing here which is by the way we're not quite fully developed is we have this teaching with PM so we're gonna have different things here and of course we have you know the absolute Brain Trust of Brenda and Helen and Vanessa and others who are working to develop teaching things so those will they'll have links here but I also have a few things here like if you're doing a lecture we have something like kind of what I talked about today what are they something about the paintings that's short um we have things about how to read one of the paintings Jennica will talk more about that tomorrow I have a whole thing here in here about the educational system if you want to talk to kids about hey there are different ways of learning and then I also have things where they're grouped so you could say well I'm interested actually in the stories about disability and then we have them here broken down the stories that are about eyesight Etc um and you can look at them different uh different ways there is also the other way of going into this is through research and lessons where you could just look yourself well oh stories about ethopian Kings or paintings with Halos or uh nature these a lot of these stories are quite extraordinary about nature and nature really um in a really amazing and Powerful way being depicted and lots of other things and then you know our team the the final thing to say is that we do have this we haven't announced it just yet because we're dealing with some bugs but um we do have the website available in a that's cool I like that just gonna say that we are the only Ethiopian studies website that has it English initially looks like an error message because we know we're learning about language you know that is not like what is happening yeah I went to a website and was all of a sudden Russian like hackers okay so Dow was supposed to do part of this and I just left in Dow anything you want to talk about here that um I guess the only thing is about for the stories when you're thinking about most popular stories it's you can easily confuse it with like the most popular stories right now you don't know why but the printed Edition that's used in the church doesn't always have the most popular stories and actually sometimes what ends up in the printed Edition is some of the rare stories from the manuscript tradition so let me back up so when we're talking about man scripts we have um a collection of manuscript tradition that goes back to 13 14th century and onwards for the past 600 years there's this manuscript tradition of you know animal skin that I talked about earlier and getting the plants and writing them down then we have the print uh addition so they printed it and then since it's printed no longer copying just print what's already you know before there's a several editions so in the prince Edition you have stories that throughout the manuscript tradition they were really popular and sometimes they make it in the print edition and sometimes they're not that popular but they still made it to the print edition but because they're prints they come into the church and they're read and the people are familiar with it you see so why that is important is especially if you have a lot of Ethiopians or something like that when you're reading and you want to like say Hey you know this story the the cannibal they're they're going to know that story but outside of that um just make sure that you're looking at okay it's popular and it's Prince right that's usually a way to kind of make sure that it's made it into the church and even then some of the print editions not all of them are read nor like uh regularly another thing to do and to think about if you are going to read like several stories in a in a classroom is to read the popular stories with the like one-offs there's some stories that are just present in one manuscript and and it appears to one time and that's it so to me it's fascinating sometimes you can learn a lot about the society that way by looking at okay what's being read a lot what's not being read as often and why you know it's just one off and one manuscript so that's just some interesting things to think about when you're selecting stories on that exact topic actually yes let's answer some questions there's a really amazing manuscript from a particular man uh Monastery called uh Debra zado and you can see here and it's all stories about things that happened at that Ethiopian Monastery and a lot of them are amazing um truly truly amazing so yes questions I was wondering if um the members of your team were here at our Workshop could could we get a recommendation of a story from each of you that might that that would work well in a high school history class I mean I teach high school but I know there are other levels in the room but could we get um some some titles a title or two from you all that they that are that are just you would recommend for the class year that would be helpful to me yeah I would I would need to think about the titles and the ID numbers but I personally like the day-to-day stories right um and these are the the type of things that people really think about when they think about the Miracles of Mary or the Miracles that she performs people generally don't think about the Canon generally they think about the day-to-day everyday experience and and um so there and those tend to be the ones written in Ethiopia around the 15 1600s so if you search in the especially the Ethiopian stories with the English translations you'll find find some of them um I would have to get back to you on the title a really good question here I don't know if you had well just one thing to say is that this one um here in the research and lessons I have the one about the Kings and there's different stories about Kings but the ones I would highly recommend are the Zar yakob he was a really important King he's really the reason why Mary's so um there's so much devotion I heard today and he often wrote them himself and he's a really gifted writer so then you can be talking about a King how he himself saw himself some about how he conquered Rebels or whatever so I think those would work really well in history class because they're about an actual historian but also kind of he geographical so it helps them to think about what's the bias or what's the orientation that would be great for your project actually talk about yeah yeah because you assume that there's filtering by you know I maybe there not there don't app yeah love to be able to take some of your expertise absolutely and you can email us I'm w belter at princ I'm really easy to find I'm always happy to answer questions I'll write out my email is pretty long so y this is something we have been working on for months to find the stories that we think are the best ones that we' developing lessons on but they're unfinished and we wanted to hear everything they had to say as well but we we are working on them we have a research for and you will be privileged to see what they are and help us [Music] develop that's a really good question who's the question um about herbal medicine you know this is there are stories where Mary is kind of a witch and she does things with like dust and um you know giving people stuff whatever but herbal I can't quite remember does have a rich history I mean you have talking to it's a really good question we should look harder to see uh to look for those and put them together like on a research post like that so you see in I did a month in India then two more months in Asia just work yeah and I'm interested in AIC medicine yeah and although my field is languages and when I grw up I think I want to be a medical doctor but I have to find you University where I can pay for the degree because a lot of people have done that but I think I'd be a good diagnos isue because I think I'm deep Sher oriented I think it comes from the brain first a lot of people AR physically ill as much as they're mentally telling the body body yeah and they need more natural paath I know we have like one minute left here a quick thing I wanted to say was um the search bar we haven't really utilized it but you could like type in themes like kings and then it'll pop up all the stories about Kings um I especially like that for paintings jenica it stop me I'm getting into your uh but if I say like for example the Madonna painting then I can have uh yes um then I can have all the paintings with the Mary with her child one thing I really like to do is okay like 1300s and then 1400s and then I can see the progression of how paintings kind of uh went over a period of time and really get your students to look at this um what was different from 13 to 14 to 1500s look at the features just by you know limiting it down to a specific thing so I think that's other ways that you could use the website that I really think is fascinating right like we're looking at African paintings from really really early periods just want to check than so best thank you thank you thank you
I absolutely love taking a look at those stories of South Africans taking pride in what they do it doesn't matter what it is it really is so encouraging next up we turn our attention to the tech world specifically with regards to education in South Africa now South Africa is a country rife with economic problems and education is one of the tools that we can equip ourselves to challenge them but with a two hundred and four billion rand budget for basic education we're still in desperate need of facilities as well as skilled teachers now joining us this morning Michael Goodman to talk a little bit about education and how via Africa is getting involved Michael lovely to have you this morning thanks very much and I love the fact are we talking about education because I always say it and I think education is one of the key things we need to focus on in South Africa to make it that better place via Africa it started as a publishing house producing text books education materials what new directions are you guys going in currently you know keeping up with with the modern times okay well obviously we started with paper because that was the technology and we've moved to digital because we firmly believe that all the problems we have in education that digital can actually solve many of them it can provide more exciting learning for learners but it can provide easy access for teachers to be able to provide basic quality lessons and better work so one of our content is now available both digitally as well as in paper and I love that I think it's going to make such a big difference in the lives of our youngsters coming up as well you know because I mean we do live in a digital era so it really a good direction but let's talk about the digital training courses that you guys are offering for the teachers but i think is a creek extremely exciting well you can tether teacher teaching and is she's confident and so the vital education Academy provides courses for teachers to become digitally literate and then digitally fluent so they can teach with technology in a classroom to have a better education because also I think a new skill that almost teaches you know that's obviously maybe have been teaching even for a while to to to migrate into a little bit more of a digital platform to be able to resonate with the kids Hector goes beyond a skill it's a whole way of thinking yes because it's skill would imply you can just take the tablet in and keep doing what you were doing that's what we working towards as helping teachers change the way education is done yes and I can just take a look as well at my boys I mean they very young at the moment but I already know how to navigate you know if I and tethers and that kind of thing so it's very important I think for teachers to be able to to know what they are doing as well but you said you got mobile as well and users can option our track donations being made to know via the F or so forth which is a great thing yeah what we've done is we realize that as you say there's too little money and people need to come to the force so we've started a campaign as support education and we offer the public the opportunity to donate towards teachers to be able to do qualifications that will allow them to become digitally competent so you can go on to the website and then donate to a teach you can do one of the digital education Academy courses so that she can feel competent in a class ok so what is that website where people can actually go to it's literally I support education don't see it as a day ok cool and for teachers I mean wanting to get involved with the via Africa app as well I mean is there were also on the website yep what you can do is you can apply for funding and also it's not just for teachers maths is a key area in our country that needs attention and through via Africa tetryl meths we able to help learners develop those skills and people can also contribute to allow schools to take on that digital program as well I love that Michael thank you so much for joining us this morning really appreciate and thank you for the work that you doing with regards to education and say that you absolutely love it there we go that's a one thing we must always focus on inside africa education is key right let's continue with your future brick show here the ladies

christian you can go on all right uh we are really excited to have all of you and this is going to be an exciting session at this point i think uh richard you can proceed and take us through uh today's agenda briefly and then you introduce our first uh presenter so over to you richard thank you so much uh christine um our agenda will be as follows oh i did i would introduce myself sorry sorry jungler from maker university institute of open distance and e-learning and also coordinator uh for these um afro-own echo online virtual community practice sessions which happen monthly so every month we have set one session like this and we discuss one topic that members request that we discuss so this community is open any issue doing open learning e-learning business learning online learning elaine will discuss it here if you have an issue you want us to discuss you discuss even if you want us to share you've got if you want to share something with the community you you you reach out to us we shared you it and then share with your colleagues so today we are going to have our case study uh presentation after yesterday presentation shall have it validated by the case validated by the subject matter expert who i'll introduce and that is by uh half past five uh east african time here and then we shall have the subject matter expert present i'll introduce a subject matter expert will present a detailed didactic case would be practical like he will be telling us you shall have a question and answer session and then you shall have announcements and then close this session so today's topic let me open here today we're going to discuss making instructional videos using screencast matic and that is a tool like we shall be told that helps us to make videos so this session is a practical session where each of us is going to work on their tool to learn how to prepare these instructional deserve to make them so to make learning more interesting and learning today matters is online but if it's online with text only text only for some reason there are aspects that we may not be able to explain using text only i need to do some demonstration we need to show our learners how to do certain things and demonstrations made much better with videos in there but the challenge you should have is preparing videos so this session to us becomes very handy and to introduce the case that we are going to discuss today is none other than doctor let me just show her brief profile here doctor oprah elizabeth atieno she's from the school of education social sciences the university of tembo and yunus of embu is in kenya she has been one of the people participating in these sessions since they began and dr ogura has vast experience in e-learning and educational administration just advanced experience and academic achievement in educational planning and right now she's in the university of m where she's a lecturer but also in charge of online capacity building and training the university of ambu so dr opura i'm welcoming you to come and present that case but also can take off just about half a minute and introduce yourself once again maybe you can show your video introduce yourself once again and then you go into the case if you wish that i share slides from this end you tell me you can also share from your end so over to you dr ogura you're welcome to present a case around videos around instructional videos for e-learning over to dr goran thank you so much uh colleagues good evening as you've been told my i'm obura elizabeth a faculty member of university of ambu and i take this chance to really thank each and every one of us present and i must note that i'm quite humbled to have this opportunity a honor opportunity to make this presentation to this community of practice the choice and the presentation that i'm going to make mainly informed by my personal experience and my personal experience with e-learning is something that stretches from my days as a student as a postgraduate student that was my first contact with the e-learning very briefly and then i transitioned very fast from that to become a faculty member and with that therefore i also had some experience with the i've had some experience with online facilitation which i believe is still working progress because the anchored on the philosophy of lifelong learning this is work in progress so my presentation colleagues is on instructional videos in online learning and this case presentation as i've said is contextualized within the university of emblem the university of ambu is one of the full public universities in kenya fully fled which was established as a constituent college of the university of nairobi in 2011 and later on received its charter of operation on october 7th 2016. so as as we are all aware the future is technology and technology is also the future so the university of hamburg though a very young university that is still emerging has not been left behind when coveted 19 struck and from my own experience i was barely one month old at the university of ambu when universities and the other institutions of learning were shot and most universities were forced into a compulsory migration towards online teaching and learning so we found ourselves there as well and to this the university management moved with a lot of speed and established a functional directorate of odell online distance and e-learning direct directorate that is functional to date having been established in 2020 in march the main essence of this establishment was to ensure that we rise to the occasion of the day and measure up to the societal circumstance that dictated that online learning becomes the order of the day so the tool that we rely on for our online facilitation at the university of ambu is the moodle learning management system and we are not fully into online facilitation per se but to presently we are still following the blended learning we have a section of our courses by requirement we are supposed to teach 50 percent of our courses online and 50 percent of our courses face to face our examinations however all administered in the face-to-face mode and therefore this still complements and is in agreement with a blended learning a structure as i've mentioned at the beginning my presentation is mainly informed by by my own personal experience and my own personal experience since kovite 19 struck with online learning is that i was later on first into becoming a full-time online facilitator for all my classes and courses based on personal circumstances that i've been prevailing since early last year up to this moment and therefore based on that i've been reflecting a lot and asking myself questions whether is it really justifiable the way we teach and of course the university management has gone an extra mile and it exposed us to quite a number of trainings and i'm glad to mention and acknowledge that one of our main trainer and mentor in online facilitation is the university of makerere and the staff present here in the capacity of doctor mahende and richard on behalf of the others quite instrumental in journeying with the university of ambu towards achieving e-facilitation or maturing in facilitation colleagues despite the numerous trainings that we have been exposed to and these trainings i'd like to mention have not only been for the lecturers alone but also for the students we continue to experience or to have the feeling that the face to face is still the most preferable mode of facilitation among both the faculty and student community at our university and where this is not the case uh we are using also the kenneth platform so sometimes we also have the preference of simply web conferencing and that is the match we are doing with our online facilitation for online courses so what happens then is that how do we design resources when we are preparing to teach mainly the selection of learning resources you agree with me from a pedagogical perspective is quite important and it should usually be informed by various factors for example the context to the characteristics of learners the topic that we are going to teach and most importantly the learning outcome that would like the learners to achieve by the end of the day so traditionally the text has been the original and the most famous or popular form of learning resource for quite a long time but there are other uh mods or media that can be used as learning resources and these include for example the video the video uh has many advantages over the text mainly because the video apart from making of simplifying complex concepts to the learner it is also very useful in the sense that it makes use of two senses the auditory as well as the vision senses and therefore this makes the level of attention and also retention of the shared information quite high among the learners this is why the use of multimedia in the form of videos can be very very instrumental and we i would like to mention that even at my own personal level the use of videos is quite common but the question is which type of videos are we using mainly if you check for example on my own courses the most common videos that i use that the videos that i download from youtube and the question why this is becoming i'm becoming uneasy with this is the is due to the fact that as i've mentioned the context in which a given youtube video was designed or developed is quite different from the context in which i'm teaching whoever designed that video may have been teaching the same topic the same concepts but the characteristics of their learners are definitely different from my own learners in my own course and in my own context of the university of aimbo and therefore it becomes a challenge that i could be using the youtube video that i've downloaded online but it is not serving the purpose and therefore it is not contributing much to the actualization of the learning outcomes that i would like my learners to attain so due to this the main challenge from experience is that our skills in designing contextualized videos is one thing and therefore because of that challenge that we experience i feel that as much as we have online learning taking place or we have the blended mode going on we have at some point especially when we are selecting the learning resources that we are going to use in our lessons or in our lectures we are at some point either disadvantaged as facilitators and also disadvantaging our own learners thereby minimizing or lowering the level of the quality of teaching and learning as delivered in the online mode and therefore colleagues this evening the question that lingers as they make this case study presentation is are there tools that can be used to make contextualized videos so that online learning can be made more clearer and easier for both the facilitator and the learner thank you yeah thank you so much uh dr bourilla for that for that case very clearly stated are there tools that we can use to develop and design contextualized videos so that learning is clearer and better maybe many people learn by seeing if you see a procedure on a video you can probably learn how to do something so our like take off about a minute or two do we have any comments from any member of the community about this do you share the same kind of challenge do you feel this is a valid uh case right now do you believe that indeed we need to incorporate videos or because of use of bandwidth if you think no we shouldn't so i'm opening up this to the community do you have any comment you want to make or any clarity you have any question you don't want to ask um dr elizabeth regarding the case that she has presented maybe to to clarify or you want to say it's similar to your situation again i'm opening up this for a few minutes before i usher in the subject matter expert so that you call it you can either type it or you can unmute and speak and speak out before we actually yes professor dig professor you animated your microphone did you want to say something okay maybe it was committed in error but if you want to say something professional degree you're welcome to say it colleagues someone wants to say to comment on this case anything to clarify or to strengthen because the issue of videos is one many of us don't have that that the professionalism of recording videos and yet there could be truths that do this easier it's just us just us uh uh thank you very much richard uh and thanks uh elizabeth for presenting that case um it is very true that you know relying on you know audio audio or or just voice may not really make learning work so well in our environment you know even where in in the previously in the african setting you know where storytelling has or had you know some kind of signs and you know to emphasize something or even when you are expressing yourself or even when it's uh an online meeting one would prefer to see the presenter you know talking how does he speak how does how does he emphasize uh something how how does he you know i find the case very very relevant and it's really the way to go thank you very much thank you so much just as for that strengthening the idea that that we as um in our communities love to you know see things being done okay yes christian yes uh thanks richard there is a question from professor ertober and uh he he says that want uh making contextualized videos give a teacher more work it is in french but translated it in english okay thank you so much so that i think the subject matter expert then dr mindy recorded that question as you present you should you tell us also whether you're want to be creating more work for ourselves or there is a way we can do it uh much better uh jeffrey your microphone is unmuted yeah i just thought the last one yes i just had a question for dr bora because she migrated her 100 of her teaching to online now um how did how has she handled the issue of accessibility uh by migrating 100 percent online with her students at the university of emir thank you uh professors ready uh elizabeth i could maybe probably comment on that and then uh we transition how are you able uh to ensure accessibility of the courses since since uh you migrated 200 percent okay thank you so much for this question as we mentioned in my uh submission of the case a presentation my migration was actually circumstantial and quite personal because i experienced an accident and therefore i've been immobile for quite some time and unable to access the university physically so i was give given this authorization a under special consideration to have my lectures conducted from the house so i was working from the house but in order to be accessible to my students i i would like to just echo that you know necessity is the mother of invention and my curiosity and passion with online learning actually was gained a lot of momentum during this period running from february last year to date because this has given me more in a has given me more momentum to just get to give my students the best because i felt i have to still deliver my lessons the way i would have delivered them if i was doing this in a face-to-face situation and considering that it was circumstantial and also very personal i felt they should not suffer or they should not pay for my own personal situation and therefore based on that i tried as much as poss i try as much as possible to be available online most of the time the way i designed the course and have it put on the lms i design as many interactive and collaborative activities for them as possible for example in the discussion forums i give them some plays just to make learning fun some some discussion forums i just created for the sake of maybe exploring or relaxing when they are on the on the platform and also respond to them promptly then i was also utilizing the use i also have put into full utilization the use of their email addresses as other avenues also of keeping in touch with them so i want to believe i am very much convinced that from the feedback i've been getting from them they've not gotten a real deal from me thank you thank you so much uh dr i have put multiple channels of access of your resources in different formats and also support structures in different formats if they can't go in the system they can youtube by mail and maybe so you have blended the support system from what i've read from your response uh christine is there any issue from that chat that we need to speak up then we transition okay christine from the chat i can see that um celestine has said that yes there's much work initially that is creating videos because elaine was asking that is work at least work subsequently so i think creating your initial videos probably may involve you putting in some time maybe scripting or whatever it is and but with time once you have once you have rolled out it becomes less costly okay let me call upon my colleague again here doctor mahende who is our subject matter expert to again take us uh further into the discussion and a practical demonstration of how we can create these these videos uh dr mahende godfrey is um let me put it just with his profile here and deputy director of the institute institute of open distance and e-learning that's mercury university with vast experience both academic in research and practice in online tools e-learning tools multimedia in education and generally blended learning several years of practice administration research and academics in the area of e-learning e-learning tools online groups and the use of many learning management systems so dr mahinde to me is the most suited person to come and talk to us about videos and also teach us teach us practically how to prepare these videos so doctor but reminded i'm inviting you to one uh greet their colleagues you turn on your video and they get to see you two you'll validate that case and eventually three you take us into the practical session for about 40 minutes okay over at your doctor mind yeah yeah thank you very much i hope everybody can hear me loud and clear yes we can hear you yeah thank you very much the debate was really very interesting and i almost thought that maybe we can even continue with this debate until the end of the session but yeah because this is really very d case that a developing video is very necessary to give alternative ways of learners to learn and sometimes easier to illustrate in terms of illustration of points for the science group so today i though there are many ways in which videos can be created or can be can be created uh there are many applications that can be used to now record make videos so many but now for for this particular presentation i'm going to  i'm going to basically talk about uh how to create video practically using uh uh screencast-o-matic so we are going to be with so it's going to be a practical session and we are going to try to make it as easy as possible so that you realize that you can also create your video without hustles without a lot of problems so that you'll be at your home and then be able to create the video on your pc so everyone uh you should do gear up or prepare to be hands-on because you are going to be doing a lot of practical and in this presentation i'm going to i am going to talk about two things one is just a small introduction and then a practical demonstration because i'm going to concentrate much on a practical demonstration but uh under the introduction i'm keeping one thing that is very vital for me here is that when you are going to make an instructional video you should plan you should plan plan for what you are going to make and and usually uh uh i also added the word and connect the reason why i say connect is try to connect your video to the intended learning outcomes so that what are the learners going to get out of this is it connected to overall course goal oh you're just making a video which is not connecting and this one is the in the course design processes so you can you must have that connector so that you don't have stray videos that are not communicating to the actual thing so planning is quite very very very vital and very important and then the other thing is you plan to make a video because you are you want to make a video so you don't just wake up one morning and you go and say let me sit over and just go through a video we also tell you that you should do a script uh instructional video script make your script prepare it you know that i'm going to talk about this then you get talking points so that you can be able to talk through the video because cameras sometimes can intimidate but you can be able to talk through your video uh you can know i'm going to start with this i'm going to go with this usually when you don't prepare there are high chances that as you talk through you realize when you hear the video oh i forgot this i don't i didn't put in this i didn't put on this kind of thing but when you prepare and know that okay these are the things i want to talk about there are four you can start your process and then you talk about those things particular points in order as they move that's very key the other thing that we we need also to know about is chunk instructional videos you don't want to give if you're going to give a lecture of two hours and then you give somebody to listen to the lecture in your of two hours i think that will be really unfair you need to chunk your videos so that you have a video which is maybe six minutes because people lose out after some time so you can even if you want to give a bigger video but you can chuck them into small small video video and also you can in the lms of course you can connect the small videos with the some kind of activities so that they can be able to listen to the videos and also go into the elements and do some uh kind of activities that are connected to that particular component so you have planned your video you know which video i'm going to from this point to that point and then the other thing i also wanted to let you know be yourself uh usually when you make a video the way you the way you go to class and make jokes and they have some humor and and like sometimes make small mistakes in the video of course you cannot intentionally it's natural so sometimes you can make a mistake a small mistake but don't say that okay i want my video i am like a machine yeah be yourself be talk uh put in some jokes put in some humor and therefore you will be cut away that you'll be activating the learners so that they can be able to be involved in the in the course very well so basically that is the theory component and the the practical component of the course which we are going to just be going through the practicals is basically i'm going to show you uh how to sign up into uh into screen customer sign up on account how to launch screencast-o-matics and i'm going to explain the interface of the screen customatics uh the webcam the screen online the boss webcam and screen i'm going to show you how to make a recording of your within this time i'm also going to show you how to save your your recording and we shall also see how to make edits and also do some captioning on the video because usually when a video is running you for inclusivity you want to also add some captioning because some people want to uh to see the captions uh yeah so you can also be able to add those kind of captioning because they help somehow and then um yes that's uh the the practical part so i'm going to go through this but i said it's going to be a practical course so we are going to find ourselves into diving into practicals but because i always want to to know that everybody is with me in the course i always ask people to to just to know that you are at this point where i am and you are with me you can just type one in the chat because we are now going to dive into practical the actual practices type one in the chat then um i will be happy that everyone is with me and is ready to start the practical session so that they can be able to do something with this practical session okay perfect i think i can see many people have been able to do that so we're engaging because you know sometimes some person can log into the computer and they are not there but when you tell them to type one it's a you know that you are dealing with the class you're not talking alone you're talking with a group of people even if i mean i mean it's a big hole alone but i know that behind me there are many people who are who are part of this whole process so i i am just going to prescribe here and i'm going to take you to uh today to the web browser so you're going to go to the web browser uh you know what a web browser is i hope you know that uh a web browser can be like chrome mozilla or depending on the on the on what you have so you can be able to go there and just we are going to have uh just let me just do this rightly yes and you you you can be able to type screencast automatic which is just here you can see it here with me screencastingcast with a dash or a minus in the middle with o and another minus and then matic.com then you'll be able to find yourself and a screencast-o-matic yeah thank you very much richard if you have been able to to to go to the screencast-o-matic site and you are there then you type 2 and then we shall be moving very well and thank you kenneth kenneth has also gone ahead and share the link in the uh share the link doctor check your chat private yes i have seen it yeah yes so basically we have been able to see that we can be able to open screencast-o-matic all of us in a in a good way that's the quite well and this is screencast-o-matic is the screen recording which creates videos and what we shall do for now we can be able to to create accounts because screencast-o-matic uh i'm not going to concentrate on the pricing but it has you can you can take you can get a license with screencast-o-matics i know you can look there and try to see on the site but you can also be able to get uh free recordings and where you can record record a video using different means so what we are we are starting with is basically how to sign up and when you go on the left on the right is is that right hand side richard you know sometimes the record for free is at the bottom left of the screen that you are displaying yes but i'm saying the right hand side on on top where they s
y sign up it's free oh yeah top right yeah so we i wanted people to create accounts i think so you can sign up uh in here by clicking on sign up here to get the an account on screen customatics by clicking on sign up yes and sign up is going to ask for is going to ask for your email address and then you can be able to proceed you can uncheck this you can check or you can uncheck so that you don't get news feeds if you want but you type there your email and therefore you will be able to create you can be able to create an account with the with screencast motif richard hello yes please good friend yes since i already have an account with the screencast-o-matics i am going to i'm going to request someone to share and we go through what he has i'll stop sharing anyone who wants to to share the screen okay maybe uh if you have been able to click on sign up and you have entered your email and clicked on continue and you have clicked on continue you can type three in the chat if you have just been able to click on sign up and you have been able to click on continue okay reverend has done that anyone else justice uh anyone else i think the one who has shared he needs to be assisted on how to reach the screen of that screen because he said the zoom zoom screen okay again he has now unshared but mama do mama yes that's very good okay so then when you do that of course it's going to ask you you need to go and verify your email uh so you you have to read your email no you don't have to click to get another one you go to your email and there you are going to confirm the account okay uh okay you can scroll down and the other people can see confirm my email so you can be able to confirm your email what is that by clicking  have i said it right richard what's the problem i don't know i'm like i'm trying to i've gotten to the level of sharing my screen you know i mean logging into to confirm my email in my accounts but i could not the confirmation is account shall i started by again uh it might sometimes it goes into the junk mail okay maybe i will confirm i'll go for it check checking the jack man yeah okay thank you thank you yes okay you can go on can you scroll down can you scroll down i think it is still processing okay i see there's that blue thing turning around on top of his screen towards the top okay maybe as he's coming if you have been able to create an account with the with screencast-o-matics uh you can type for in the chat if you have successfully gone on to enter your details and then create an account with a screencast-o-matic you can just type for in the chat so that we can have some okay yes that means they are for moving uh very fast but at least say okay you can now put your password we don't want yes please don't show the password they are telling you the password must include those figures and i can see it is giving you uh it's giving you ticks where you have not included wanna practice later i think you have not included in that one so that's why it's it's refusing there's something missing listen yes yeah those ticks there's one missing so maybe you can put an uppercase later perfect you can click there in that confirm and then click ctrl a select the whole thing and then you delete now in the because it's not going to accept anywhere because they see that the confirmed password is very long is something wrong so you need to remove that and then put the right one it must be the same like the one which has you have put up we are doing this for purposes so recording so that you can even see that and then you click on create accounts okay that's how you can be able to log in if it's your my machine definitely you can save i normally do that a lot yeah okay you can stop uh sharing and i know that you can also be able to log into your now using your username and password which is your email and then password so here when you log into your when you log into your screen customatics okay let me just i don't have right stop you from sharing but uh kenneth can you help me wonky to stop sharing so that i can share okay you can stop sharing you can go to the top of the screen you find something that says stop sharing okay so thank you so much for demonstrating to us yes oh we are so glad dr mindy what is going on yes now what we have seen and that those who have finished uh uh many have finished logging in and they have the accounts there and i am now going to share you can log into your account on your account the one you have created so you can log in and you will be inside your inside the swincustomatics okay now i'm going to share my screen again hello godfrey i have a little question okay yes please do that yeah of the options displayed i want to use our account educational personal business which you advise us to choose um i think this is a but but they are most likely they want you to take you into a plan whether you want to pay for education or pay for business but yours is definitely educational okay but now you already created an account you could go to screencast-o-matics and you can be able to log in but educational plan is much better all right so we must choose now before we can log in yeah you could do avoid and then you log in or you can just choose education but you are not going to pay now because we are going to use the free version all right thank you good okay thank you ed if you have a question please we said we shall allow questions anytime that's what richard said isn't it written yes please okay when you log into your your account i expect that you will be able to see i will be able to see uh this kind of thing which you can do is telling record for free and edit for free record for free and also you can send to free

can stop sharing and then we say for just us then we we can solve this once and for all guess us you just share now okay when you click on because i want when you click on screen customize yes click there what so when you click on screencast-o-matic link you'll be able to get uh record for free so those who have uh who had the challenge you could be able to do that and everyone would be able to have to have the code for free there and those who have record for free you can now click on record for free because it's now going to download please you can stop sharing uh you click on record for free and then you it will start downloading depending on the speed you are having so we want at this point richard hello richard yes please yes please uh we we want if somebody is able to download screencast-o-matic and he has downloaded it then we you can type a six in the chat okay so if you have been able to download screencast automatic type six in the chat a question has come to me direct that where do you click to download okay i see i have seen it also here from justice i think to everybody let us first check and then we shall request justice to share but what we said you click on we we said record for free is where you click yes that's what you had there when you went on screencast-o-matics there was a record for free and when you go to record for free then that's when you can be able to download okay yes this is here again sharing okay uh and now good guesses then you click on launch prerecorder please you can do that then you click on launch pre-recorder after you have done that you click on launch free record adjusters and all the others click on launch free corner once the process is over things are going to be much easier so if you if you you get your i expect you i'm just going to share screen and i show you if uh who is this christian you click on screen customatics which is up here you see that click on that perfect it will bring you to the other point we wanted it will bring you to record for free and then you can also launch yes yes once you have uh now okay i need to minimize this first okay once i i will just share again my screen are you able to see something on my screen yes and what are you saying you can speak and then we know what you're saying record what i think you're saying record so when you launch screencast-o-matic you are going to see an interface like the one you are seeing with me i can just try to to make it slightly smaller here there is something with with with the dotted lines uh distributed line with the record screen webcam both are you here after downloading yes we can hear you yeah i want to ask you you have this window after downloading so mine is i want to know how you got to this stage could you stop share i think i am i maybe i have been very fast yeah i've stopped sharing look at this yes i mean that okay i wanted to remove this okay uh yes you can share christine um just a minute again oops yes somebody kenny says there's a white and black demarcation lines when you finish there will be and that is the area which you can be able to record we are going to see that yeah but you can share somebody maybe uh somebody else can share as christian is trying to get if you are having you haven't reached there but i know that the download sometimes depending on the speed you're having it may take longer than the normal time but okay who is that one this is not like okay i saw this came up dr main did you see my my screen yes so okay you can double click on that okay  and i open yep you can't see the dialogue that came back to me and is that okay because we don't see the dialogue that came with with it oh okay like we in the shared area we can't see that but but i hope it's took you back here okay you click on launch launch free recorder determined maybe if i can come in uh for those using mac the mac laptops when you're installing and something is trying to record the screen mark will ask for special permissions so you will have to accept and give that application you have installed special permissions to record on the screen yes so would i now click open screen here kristen you're using a marker yes hey okay now i can i can see yeah uh it requires some permission when you are installing i think maybe we shall need to do some special help for christie anyone yeah any anyone i want somebody who has been able to if you have been able to have that dotted line and you have installed your screencast-o-matic can you just share the and type type seven in the chat if you have been able to download because i know there are different speeds that we are we are having and some people yeah it might see it may take longer because of the the speeds on the on the computer to download the application okay you are using mobile app menu okay uh walker maybe we tell we tell robert robert can you share your screen robert robert roberts okay good perfect robert robert has shared the screen and you can see uh that he dotted line perfect no but robert is actually there uh let me also get from someone else robert i can you can stop sharing robert i'm going to ask ali can you share your screen just for me to know that you are at the right point with me aniwa yes good that's promising you understand that yeah because there are some who the speeds are very low and they may not be able maybe they are not going to get very fast because it's taking longer but the good thing we are making a video now i'm going to uh you can stop sharing ali because there are many names are coming up with the downloading people are downloading and i can see that they are already seeing what i expect because of what we have shared here so i'm just going to to to to them to explain some things that are in there so when when you go to when you are there where you are now with those screens allow me allow me share my screen okay now i am sharing my screen uh and the the dotted what you are seeing as a dotted line when i can expand this bloated area because that will be the recording area i can push the noted area maybe i can push it down drag just like the windows i can come to this side and expand it i can come to that side and expand it the way i want depending on what i want on the window but forever so you think water is there i can just make it slightly that and when you do that now you have your screen because the recorder records the screen then you have this option you can i will just show you that you can be able to see if i want to record the screen if i want to record the screen i will click on screen um let me just hit put just the screen no webcam so when i say record the screen so it will just record the screen alone so if you have a powerpoint in that area it will be recording the screen alone if i want to record the webcam if i click on webcam then i will be recording i will be recording myself in a webcam i don't know let me just do that okay i will be recording myself in the webcam i'll be appeared in here but because i think i'm on i'm on zoom and i'm also uh it is now not showing in here in the webcam because i'm double i'm doing a demo a double system uh but then you also can be able to say i want to watch i want to do both i will have a small screen down here which you can also take to any place you want a small screen down and then i have also a powerpoint presentation which i will be recording and talking over so there there there there's a screen only you want to record a screen only you want to talk through some kind of demonstration or illustrate a picture but you want to do a screen only and talk over it or you want to do a webcam you want to to get a video introducing yourself uh i am god free my ending doing this and this and making some introduction of myself and the other one is a you want to to get uh you want to get both both the webcam and you also want to get the screen many times you have seen that someone is recording a powerpoint and he has his picture on the bottom and sometimes you want to drag you can drag this and put it at the top if you want depending on where you want it to be uh but you could also but many times this one is down on the the bottom yeah so it can be able to do that so now when you say i want now maybe we said we go to the webcam only uh i can't see my webcam uh myself because of i think i'm using zoom and i'm also maybe let me just click here that webcam no integrated camera no it's not showing because i'm using zoom uh on my i'm on camera on zoom and i'm also in the screencast-o-matics and that's why i think they problem is now when you have your your video is going to be here it will be shown here where you are you you're going to introduce yourself uh you're going to introduce yourself and if you want introduce yourself or if you want let us start with the webcam only i want to introduce myself and i have made my script and i will introduce myself maybe i'm going to talk about my my names i'm going to about my experience which i've been doing i've been teaching this class and this is me from maker university so you just come here there's the word record this record will appear even when you have screen only or when you have both so you click on record now for example you're going to record on webcam and you say you you you point your camera very well and i would request that you also get lighting a good lighting to be able to do that and then you you click on and you click on record record will i put some three counts and then to start recording uh i am good friend allende uh from academy university uh in the institute of open distance and e-learning and once you're done you have introduced yourself you can just go and click stop and this can be done you can do this using um when you have screen only you have a webcam only or you have both of them and once that is done you have stopped then you can be able to see that the number of minutes will be recording here how many minutes have you spent talking so that you can even evaluate as you go and then you reach somewhere and you're going to stop the recording and once you are done like you have stopped the recording then you click on you click on done i'm going to just you click on done so it's telling me won't it fail to capture anything okay maybe because i'm doing double double recording but that that recording will give you you when you click on there you can have the option of saving let me just do screen only and see okay let me stop sharing this and go through okay i am just going to to try to use the the screen only so if i have a powerpoint for example this powerpoint that i have and in this powerpoint i'm just going to  let me just put okay let me put full screen on powerpoint and it's going to be recording so i can just come here and i say i need only this powerpoint and i click on record then it is going hello class you're welcome to course edt 7205 uh this is going to be your lecturer good friend allende uh from kerry university and this course is going to run between this and then when you are you have finished click on stop that and then you are going to click on done then will allow you to do edit video if you want anything instantly quick share but let's look at saving so you click on save click on save and save allows you the possibility now to even pre-check your video so i want to check my video i don't know if i shared let me share again so that i share audio with it because i'm going to play share and share sound as well okay so here it allows me now to have this kind of the video which i've been recording and i can just come here and say play it a little bit and see hello class you're welcome to course edt 7205 uh this is going to be your lecturer good friend allende from a career university and this course is going to run between this and then when you are you have finished you click on yes and now here we are able to see and we are able to see that uh of course when you do that you now click on save video file so you click on save video file but you can also upload if you have a license and space on screen customatic itself but i always do saving on that but when i do a pre-check pre-check and i realize that maybe there are things that are not good maybe there are gaps i have the option of editing but we shall look at that later so you click on save the file uh save the file here brings this dialog box that you see here and the it has the option of where the folder is where you need to know where you are going to save your video so you click on that folder and you can browse to to get either in my documents or you create a folder where you want it to be saved for me i usually save in a new videos so when i go there and i click on browser i will find it is somewhere under judgment but i put new videos there so that's why i'm saving so i'm not going to do that then here so the next uh so here you just click on click on publish publish then we'll start rolling that to save this particular file and once the file is saved you can click ok so means that your file will be you'll be able to see it here but you can also be able to go to your file through you can see it can pop like this or you can just go to the folder on where you have created that particular file let me just minimize this when i go  to um when i go to my when i go to  here and i go to my documents and i go to uh new videos where i've just put under new videos i'm going to find that the recordings are going to be here and this will be just an mp mp4 file which you can send to the students through whatsapp depending on the size or you put you load it into youtube and then you can be able to yeah i can i want i just want because i've covered i think a lot of ground because i wanted it to show how you can go to the either my screen only or by camera or by by i can receive some questions at this point richard so thank you so much uh godfrey for that i know because that it's really a lot of work to do in a short time but the good thing is that we're recording and won't share with every with our colleagues whoever tells this session um maybe one or two questions if there's someone who just asks something there's a quick one here yes please thank you god for a very good delivery i want to ask um the difference between saving the video and publishing the video so do you have to do both or are you is one free to choose either to save the video or publish the video and when you publish the video where do you find it okay richard can i respond yes please you respond yes yeah the process of saving the video includes clicking on publishing publishing it and the there are four you and and that's what i was i was telling you that you have to choose a folder uh when before you when you click on save there's this dialog box you choose where you want all your videos to be saved so that you can be able to look for them when you click on publish after click on publish you'll be able to find your file in that area all right thank you very much you're welcome thank you so much um david yes thank you for that good presentation my question is about the environment under which you can record this sometimes we may have noise interferences must you do it in a studio or anywhere that's your comment usually usually what for me i do i do it at home when everybody has the when everybody has slept and there was there's no noise but if you can find a studio perhaps you could do that but see you know sometimes for this particular thing even if there is some little kind of noise in a small small not big noise then it can also be natural so but me i normally one time i recorded a video when i was the uh during night and the unfortunately group and then it was inside my video and i have to repeat again the whole process so you just try to avoid like sometimes you're in office and you have kept your office open as you record somebody opens the door then the sound is going to get into your video so sometimes you try to either look your door or try to say that i'm recording uh you tell somebody please don't come here i'm just recording because usually recording is not a long process uh few minutes yeah okay thank you so much godfrey thank you so much david for that question uh moses yeah thank you uh presenter and and richard this application works online strictly or it kind of work offline if i think if you it can also work offline not strictly because now we are we have been using the when you download it it's much easier but when you have a when you have a license like like the one me i'm having then i don't have to i i don't i i can even make recordings without actually referring to any online i don't i can work offline okay so thank you so much and someone is asking that how long does the free versions uh go for how long 15 minutes the free one yes you are given 15 minutes of recording if you are taking the free version if you are attending the free version you can record it one single video a maximum of 15 minutes not beyond that i mean that's each video yes but uh for how many months they give me free that free access it's endlessly it's it's endlessly because it's just like zoom uh it gives you the free version as long as you are like there are limitations in the free version oh there are things you can have in the in the paid up version depending on the plans you have gone to okay and then document how how long would you recommend a learning video to be six minutes six minutes maximum yes for me i would i would recommend six minutes because the the interest the nana loses interest i think after that point right someone wants to know the difference in screencast-o-matic and ice spring in terms of i know that you have used ice spring before i have not used ice cream okay yeah yeah but this one actually is the screen screen recording i don't know whether the ice cream also does the screen recording but yeah yeah and jp chang is asking whether there's a remedy for mac users and dr chang i think you you give us your contact in the chat and then i request kenneth to get the contact of dr chang and then try to work with the dr chang regarding using mac mac computers then i think she'll have these two and then we close we have uh martin oh martin bonjour bonjour mr richard good evening evening okay yes martin gone yes i want to say that you will register i just wanted to say that in order to register very well the first thing you have to do is to have a microphone microphone does not register the other noises around even during day you can have very good results another thing is to use the anti-noise filter and it is a filter that you use in front of a microphone and it avoids all the pop noise and the quality of a video is first of all based on the sound the sound is very important even if the pictures are not good the sound must be good that is why i'm recommending a microphone that is a multi-directional and then that is anti-pop sound so a video capture telephone they can be sent on the phone as well thank you dear presenters godfrey did wonderful a wonderful job thank you very much yeah thank you merci uh germany for that uh comment yeah thank you so much we need a microphone and can we can we have a filter good friend uh then lastly we have bossy bossy i don't know your hand is up do you want to say something yes now i have a question actually yes okay i observed that uh when i was trying to you know um sign up to the screencast or mathematic i tried you know immediately i i was following the process but when i noticed people like the one you showed the sample of some somebody where care or whatever that it gave the person opportunity to sign feeling names and others but mine i just saw the option of you know entered through google accounts lately i entered i just and you know i just saw the interface that we are having you know like the interface of now free to click on free launch free recorder and then when i launched it i was able to download and now came here so is it you know does it mean that i didn't register very well or how come it went like that for me you yes you registered very well because these days sometimes when you want to to register uh sign up they also allow you you can use your google account directly and then you don't have to enter details because they will be automatically so you were able to do it well uh and reach richard slivers as soon as a request is required privately also requesting for the recordings asking will we be able to get the recording of the presentation i was traveling i could not do it practically it's really nice up so please take note about that all right so we're going to share that please okay yeah so thank you so much colleagues i think we have overshot our time by 90 minutes but this is very interesting i document i'm seeing an opportunity of having to call you again to come and do more of this so that we can take it a little bit slow and and complete um this thank you dr mindy uh by concluding today's that the link has been put back in the chat but dr mindy just let me request you to give one last word in half a minute okay uh thank you thank you very much richard i think we we have had a very interesting deliberation the it was a short time and there was a lot of um uh it was not easy to finish everything after after the end but the class was very engaging and many people were able to go through the process and i am really impressed and happy and and i'm looking forward even because we didn't cover some of the things but at least if somebody can be able to make a recording after that point that is a plus and i'm really happy for that over to you thank you so much kenneth has posted the youtube link i think it's for the recording still could you download that

we started to discuss this the use of technology in education uh a number of years but the there has been an increasing focus in the africa region how we can really take advantage of digital technologies uh in in education then to enhance learning productivity efficiency effectiveness so that the systems can be become more efficient and effective in the delivery of education in basic and secondary education but also in the tibet and the higher education today we will have this training the today as i said uh the alex and the team will start the one thing really i have been last few years as i have been viewing different uh projects at project appraisal documents or look at some of the implementation the question becomes how effective uh how we are able to operationalize uh the use of technologies in education that to me that is at the end what it matters uh we have been using this uh you know the concept the use of technologies for many many years but now the question becomes how we can really take advantage of it especially in light of uh covet 19 i think that really highlighted in many of our countries uh remote learning uh the two years ago we were discussing more how to take advantage to enhance learning but now also to deliver learning actually to use by using digital technologies so uh without much introduction actually you know alex he's a part of our gate team uh alex i'll ask you to introduce you and your your team uh and then give us the context actually uh today and tomorrow what you would like to do and also how our colleagues can reach um uh to you uh to seek your guidance advice as we try to operationalize and scale up some of our activities uh implementation activities in this area alex over to you thank you khalil and good morning good afternoon colleagues it's a pleasure to be here today my name is alex trinham gisha i'm part of the global ed tech team uh and i would really like to extend a great thanks to halil and your fellow pms for giving us this opportunity as the edtech team uh to make uh this to conduct this training and hopefully share some insights but we would also like to hear from you from the ttl's on what the issues are the questions on the ground today we'll be focusing on digital foundations kind of the key foundations to use a deck so the devices uh the content uh the learning management systems um and the education management information system so we'll take we have an interesting format that we are going to follow uh and then tomorrow uh we'll kind of look more at around the uh capabilities and applications um and we will look at assessment which is has been a very hot topic during covid how do we assess remotely and an increasing hot topic in education i will look at literacy apps which feeds into our learning poverty agenda i will look at the skills teachers need to have especially to support things like remote learning and then we'll end with a fascinating discussion around uh recovering from learning losses using tutoring and remedial bob will give some kind of more insights uh now um and then um uh we mike will be the overall moderator for these two days um i think everybody knows bob and mike we have a number of consultants uh today uh that will be making the presentation um and uh you you'll get a chance to meet them all uh please use the chat to post any questions and um we'll also post an email in which you can contact us uh with that uh thank you again halil and over to bob and we can kick off the formal agenda thanks hello mike and alex great to be here with everybody this morning um just very quickly i think i just want to reiterate one thing that alex said that with the edtech team we've been trying to listen to kind of what your demands are what you're hearing from clients what are your main binding constraints and how we can help you think through how to most effectively uh design and implement edtech components to improve teaching and learning particularly uh during this time of covid when schools were closed but i think increasingly as countries are looking towards uh building a more resilient system for hybrid learning um we launched our strategy paper or approach paper this past year which has five principles the first one is ask y and we've used this as a framework for dialoguing with you on how to think about the integration of edtech and you'll hear this i think throughout these next few days is always asking why what what is the purpose of this investment what do you want to see in terms of the changes in the classroom the second is for all at scale and i think you'll hear a lot about digital infrastructure uh frederico will talk today about devices um so looking about kind of this access issue which is a is a huge uh issue across all of our countries uh and different ways in which to bridge the these new digital divides around access the third is empowering teachers so at the heart of education is the teacher and as alex said we'll talk about that more tomorrow in terms of the changing role of the teachers the new skills that are being asked of teachers and how at the end of the day technology can better empower them uh and then the the the fourth area is engaging the ecosystem recognizing that ministers of education cannot do this alone and i think part of this also is the time needed for ministries of education to be able to really assess and integrate technology and this gets to the fifth principle which is be data driven which is kind of the the changing role of ministries of education to be able to use data in a more real-time environment to be able to make decisions more effectively and to be able to build system resilience so again i just wanted to emphasize these five principles that will be woven into the discussion over these next uh two days and again we really want to hear back from you uh do these knowledge packs resonate with the challenges you're facing we started to develop these over a year ago in response to demand uh from a number of different countries not just in the africa region but across the portfolio so this is an opportunity for you to give us feedback also as to are these the questions that you really need to have answered so again thanks so much and looking forward to the discussion over mike will take it on from here on um you know introduce the presenters and and then um also moderate the q and a over to you mike thanks so much um hello alex and bob we have a jam-packed session this afternoon this morning we will kick it off with 10 minutes of presentation and 10 minutes of discussion um from frederico cavallo he'll be talking about devices in education and i'll remind all presenters to please keep to your time i will be cutting in if you go over time because we have uh four great discussions today and we want to make sure we get to all of them with that said i turn it over to you frederico he's starting to share his content now everyone please do post questions comments concerns information in the chat we'll be monitoring it throughout over to you federico hello everyone good morning uh thanks for the opportunity to be with you today um i will be focusing as mike said on on devices and the uh this will be really a sneak peek into the the knowledge back that that was created uh and intended just to uh give you a high level flavor of what uh what's uh inside um the the main thing that we're trying to answer with this knowledge back is how can we make better decisions when we try to deploy device in education so that's what i'm going to cover today within the next 10 minutes and then try to answer any questions that come up so the first thing is how do we determine the right device for education and we're proposing a four-step approach the first one being you know following what bob was saying about asking why now what is it that we're trying to achieve with deploying a device what is what is a learning experience that you're trying to support with that device and we call those use case scenarios and i'll i'll show you some examples of those in a couple of minutes once we've determined the the different use case scenarios that we're trying to to support the next thing is to be realistic and really understand what is the current situation what environment are we trying to deploy these devices on and so i'll also show you uh some of the different scenarios and what implications that has on the choices that we make um of the devices uh the third is obviously then what are the solutions that we're gonna deploy and the solutions is not just a device but everything that goes around the device and a very important aspect in choosing the solutions is to pay attention to the core what we call the total cost of ownership which is looking beyond just the cost of the initial cost of the device but really of everything that needs to be in place during the lifetime of the device to make sure that uh the user teacher student um has is has the ability to use that device throughout this lifetime and finally um the recommendation is to to learn and not to be afraid to look into really what's happened and make different decisions if that's the case moving forward so here the invitation is really to um evaluate the experience um and try to improve from each deployment uh to another to really improve with the experience of the game so moving forward to the the use case scenarios so these are just some examples of some of the scenarios that we might want to support from a learning perspective that are aligned with the issues or strategies that you have to solve those issues um [Music] had that are defined to support some of the existing challenges so for instance if you're uh looking at a scenario in which a challenge is to support children out of school so obviously you're looking to distance education your use case scenarios is the ability for teachers to create deliver and manage remote lessons another use case scenario could be from the student perspective to be able to engage in remote learning and throughout the whole process to support formative assessment right maybe in a synchronous manner so how does the device support that um and we need to look at what are the features and the conditions in which this device will be used so that we can achieve this learning experience so that takes us into the the next level and the next level is really to look at what the existing conditions that we're going to operate on there's two critical dimensions for technology to work they're quite obvious but sometimes not really considered adequately uh when we're designing the project and the first one is obviously electricity and it's availability and reliability and the second dimension is the connectivity so we if we have uh or not electricity available where we deploy technology if that electricity is more or less reliable or if it's you know just working properly and the same for internet and this will affects significantly the key features of the devices that we will consider uh for instance if we're operating in an environment where there's no electricity and we'll have to support solar charging and there might be limited internet maybe just mobile internet service obviously we're looking probably at mobile devices we can't consider a pc lab with desktops um we'll be looking at things that have a low power consumption probably large battery capacities and large storage because we will be operating probably without being able to to charge very frequently and we'll probably have to store a lot of the um a lot of the content on the device itself and this is just one example to illustrate how the existing conditions will predefine what's possible the next level is then to look at so what's the right device now we know what we're trying to achieve and here are just again some of the educational objectives that you might have set up and some of the use case scenarios related to those uh educational objectives and this is just a empiric evaluation of the um the suitability of a certain device to support a use case and so you'll see that there's devices that are broader in the support of different use case scenarios and others that are more adequate to certain use case scenarios than others there's also another dimension which is really important when we're defining the right device which is the age group that we're we're dealing with so if the device is for very young kids grade one and two where they're learning to read and write you know there are certain features that we will be looking on the device that are very different um if we're addressing those devices to students that are you know in higher education or in college and so depending on the use case scenarios and what what we're going to do with the device it's really important to consider the form factor and the features of the device and moving forward within devices i think one one aspect that is really frequently overlooked uh throughout many of the projects is that uh a device that we deploy the cost of that device is not just the acquisition cost there's a number of other costs involved that actually make the total cost of deploying that device much higher than the acquisition cost and sometimes governments and your clients in this case get fixated on the initial acquisition cost and they totally disregard things like the deployment costs the cost of operation and also the disposal and replacement costs so an example that i i came across recently you know in a in a certain country in africa android tablets were deployed their cost was x uh and at the end of the year this was in an unconnected uh environment at the end of the year these tablets will be retrieved and will be just reformatted and everything will be installed and redeployed again and the reality in this specific case was that they were able to only reduce half of the tablets and the majority of those retrieved had issues needed repairs physical repairs and they estimated the lifetime of those tablets to be around two to three years so they decided to replace those tablets in 2017 with the ruggedized laptops running windows the cost of those laptops was double of the android balance but the reality is that their experience retrieving them uh was much higher because they were branded and ruggedized and was really hard to hide the fact that it was specific to that project and the majority of them at the end of the year did not need repairs and lasted much longer than the tower so at the end of the day they realized that the total cost of ownership of the the lab the ruggedized laptops was actually lower than the um the tablets uh so an invitation here is really to when designing a project to consider all the costs involved in running these devices throughout their their lifetime and so some some guidance um is around the fact that um some of the initial costs usually are somewhere between 30 to 40 percent of the total uh the total costs uh really depends if you consider training in this or not um or if you just uh considering the the the costs directly related to keeping those devices running but it's important to keep these these numbers uh in mind and there's a lot of experience so we can share some experiences from different countries around um how these uh different costs impact the total cost of ownership so moving forward to um the the last uh the last um uh i'm missing a slightly i'm not sure why so anyhow um one of the most important things in in in any project is to make sure that we're learning from from what's happening and we incorporate that learning into the different phases of redesigning the project so any deployment should follow usually three major phases we've seen that a lot of the projects move very swiftly uh from a manifesto announcement by president to the deployment what we would call the deployment phase totally um overriding the first phase which should be the design of the project so design is really when we clearly identify with what we're trying to achieve we put a team in place we identify what are the use cases and what are the right devices we budget for the whole project not just for the acquisition we prepare the whole environment to accommodate those devices we focus on risk mitigation on looking for interdependencies for instance with electricity and connectivity and we communicate communicate communicate communicate which is one of the key things and then we can move on to the next phases of the project which are about deploying which i'm sure many of you are very familiar with and finally uh once it's deployed another overlooked aspect is the sustainability aspects so i'm going to stop here uh i'm on top of my time i believe uh mike and if there's any comments or questions i i can take them thank you so much federico everyone that was a preview of a much larger knowledge pack and a preview of an upcoming uh in-depth session as part of the world bank policy academy on devices in education we'd be happy to take questions for frederico now already see one in the chat federico about uh handheld devices what uh what is the current thinking around handheld devices in education i guess it could we could be talking about phones in particular but what do you see happening with uh phones and other handheld devices where are they being used by whom are they appropriate or not yeah i think once again that depends on what we're trying to achieve and what's possible uh and those are always the two dimensions uh what we're trying to achieve goes back to the use case scenario so what is it are we trying what learning experience are we trying to support and what is possible what can we afford and what conditions we have to deploy so if i've seen a lot of examples around you know using a mobile phone just to send reminders or to send snippets of information uh to keep the communication with the parents um you know those could be perfectly uh suitable for those use case scenarios now if we're trying to uh support project-based learning and collaboration uh maybe a handheld device will not be the the most suitable uh device to support those use case scenarios and so i i think it really depends on what we're trying to achieve and then what conditions we have if we're trying to leverage what exists already so we will be limiting what what's possible to to do the capabilities of the device um if what i see very frequently is that we limit our thinking to what exists and now not what's possible and so the invitation would be always to let's see what we're really trying to achieve and then let's bring it down to reality and see within that what's what's possible and how and so and how devices could play a role there but that really depends on what we're trying to achieve we need to design the learning experience and then see that's that device will support them up to where it will support excellent thank you what are some good practice examples of you have this three-stage process of design deploy and sustain are there places we should look federico for uh good examples in real life or maybe where we should look uh for bad examples that we make sure we don't want to uh repeat yeah i think there's there's a few good examples of people that have been doing this for a while um the the one that always comes to mind that might not be applicable to many parts of africa is uh uh plan several in uruguay they were one of the first countries to broadly deploy technology and they've been learning a lot with experience and so with time they've put in process uh in in place uh a dedicated um institution focusing on supporting that project and they've been running it like uh i would say almost an enterprise so it's very professionalized the way that they run these deployments for the past 13 years and so i think there's a lot to learn there um the fact that they have very good connectivity might be the the aspect that is a bit different from um many parts of africa that i know are much more limited in their their um connectivity but the principles behind how it's been managed i think they're they're very good example uh i remember portugal uh back in 2007 when they decided to deploy devices to all students they also deployed the way they've done it is a very good example to look at one of the biggest learnings of all these projects is when governments decide to create an independent entity to run these projects and not just have it under some ministry in a lot of um you know political aspects and uh i think one of the big learnings is um to allow an independent entity to manage these process these projects and there's quite a few examples on how that that works the other thing is whenever there's partnerships with the private sector um i think that that that's a big learning you know how thing is doing that for instance for um for the hoping i mean the profits in south africa they've outsourced the whole operation of the devices and so they rely on on the private sector partner to to make sure that everything is working and there's there's a number of other examples that could be talking you know for a lot longer so i'll stop here for now could i ask a question please hello uh thanks so much for very good presentation many of uh many of our projects the i cover the western and central african countries nigeria sierra leone ghana and so on they i mean your presentation is very clear a lot of uh the connectivity and power are essential but there are solutions i guess as i hear and uh uh the countries have been using devices different devices for the purpose of management the management information systems the data collection the including topics the challenges we have been hearing from our uh manager uh there's some background news actually i don't know mike uh the challenge is that how do we use the different devices to improve teaching learning why cannot try we cannot transform and then provide and i'm just simplifying the solution why don't we just provide everyone tablets and we load them all the content i'm just simplifying the equation so how do we use technology more capacity [Music] to improve uh learning uh the i'm going to give you example in sierra leone or in one of the states in nigeria uh low capacity and then you have the solution but you don't have the really affected teachers low accountability uh and then okay can we find something you know especially during this coming times uh by providing the loaded you know with the content at this top left everyone you solve the problem i'm just simplifying but this is the uh this type of question we often receive from different uh different cards what's what would be your response uh then you have funding and then help us to design a program and then we solve the i problem that's an awesome question um i think there's this uh uh idea or dream that if we did we free deploy technology everything will be sorted out and problems will just disappear and the reality is the opposite technology is just one small element of the overall solution um before kovit and i think that that there is a before covert and after kovit a bcna ac before covid when kids were in school we had everyone in the same classroom and a lot of interventions had to do with helping teachers do a better job teaching and creating learning experiences and that could be achieved in a number of ways um no additional content uh pre-packaging uh the the lessons and so on some mentoring when when that was possible or or teacher coaching uh in cases where there was connectivity you know even teachers from other parts of the country to to support the learning um i think that all of that was required to improve the learning experience with the support of technology so we it's been well researched that justifying technology makes no difference sometimes even makes a negative difference in the learning and so it's everything around that that that makes it work now with students being at home i think that the problem just got bigger because connectivity at home is sometimes even more limited than than in schools uh the fact that kids are not now not next to their teachers and it's harder for them to help with each other um and so the problem has just been amplified and so so i think it's really important now to um find ways to support parents who support their kids whenever that that's possible i know that illiteracy you know makes that very hard but just the fact that parents accept that kids can learn at home with asynchronous approaches find ways for maybe small groups to get together and get some support from the teacher once in a while uh it's really critical i think that we're all learning on how to to work on uh remote learning in um in environments where the conditions are not ideal um but if things were already not just about the device and technology before i think they're even less now um they're really about helping the whole community support the learning experience and i think we're still figuring it out i think all countries are kind of in the same boat but one thing is clear what we had to do before to make projects successful it hasn't changed we still continue to to have to support the teachers in adopting technology to support them being effective and to provide digital content and whenever possible use this opportunity to improve the electricity availability and the connectivity availability and we've seen a great example in kenya on how a large-scale technology deployment was also a catalyst to electrify the country and i think it's all about combining these elements to to to have a bigger impact thank you very much federico and and on this topic of combining the elements we'd like to now move to uh another piece of the puzzle uh that as we design uh we think about devices we need to be thinking about what's running on these devices and we will move to content please feel free to reach out to fred and the world bank edtech team as we said this is just a preview of a whole set of discussions and an insight into a whole set of discussions that the team is having with uh with uh task teams across the bank and with clients please keep the questions coming in the chat thanks so much fred uh for uh a taste of of of the richness of the challenges that we have in front of us related to devices and education we now want to move to what runs on these devices digital educational content i would like to uh arya mogos or rmr esther i'm not sure who is speaking first if you could please share your screen uh and we will move over to you esther is starting please introduce yourselves as you speak esther and aryam and over to you um good morning everyone i don't know if you can hear me perfectly clear esther and arya perfectly clear i see our thumb and and you can see my screen yes we can thank you very much so my name is esther rashicho i'm from kenya um i am mainly dealing i mainly deal in education technology programs and currently in this particular program i'm working with ariam and ed uh on developing uh digital content knowledge pack so i'll take you through the slides uh very briefly and my team who are with me will also assist in answering any questions that would come by so my apologies um i can't turn on the video i'm in the bush somewhere and the internet keeps fluctuating so i believe my team will be able to take over in case of anything uh so as i start well in i want to begin from a point that was uh shared in the chat where do we when at what point do we bring the conversation between devices and content uh before deployment and that would begin by saying that it is very important to actually have that that discussion long before you even put in the infrastructure because um the devices the lms and all the infrastructure in place will not really yield a lot of uh will not yield much if content is not considered so we've seen instances where we've had government roll out large scale education technologies without really considering two things two main items and one of which is that uh the teacher's capacity to use these devices and the digital content that is going to be used in them so this is on one area that we think is very important and very critical uh before deploying any infrastructure that conversation needs to uh to be had um at the same time the decision makers and ministries and governments before they can uh decide to or because they can't decide to bring in content as i've said once they've had that conversation there's several other things that they'll need to consider before they do that one of these is in regards to acquiring content and in the process of teaching and learning one of which is what digital content is right for your intervention and this can only happen once you've had that conversation that i've talked about so that you realize what is our need as a country and what content will we get and i'll address some of this as we move along what content will we require to get that will address these needs based on the resources that we have the other thing that we need to consider before bringing in content would be um what i just mentioned earlier on the infrastructure lms devices and so on and all that are not will only make sense if we have content that the students interact with the other consideration that we need to look into is identifying the appropriate uh their appropriate use and several case scenarios that are going to present represent themselves to us and what are our goals and objectives so that when we are making a choice of what content we are going to use these scenarios are addressed this objective is addressed and this goes addressed and this includes uh areas of geographical dispensation where our learners are we need to consider that also before we make that decision of what content to get the other thing is we need to identify problems that need to be addressed or solved and how digital content might help to address some of these challenges a good example in africa we have a we have an imbalance in terms of the teachers we have us as the learners we have in the schools it is a good thing to consider uh whether this digital content that we bring on board is going to help us deliver learning where especially in such areas where we do not have teachers adequate teachers in other places we have pastoralists who keep moving up and down in search of pasta for their animals and if we are going to consider these kids digital content could be one of those things that we can consider with the devices that are coming to play that would help address the challenge of the learning continuing even as this pastoralist moved from one place to the other convict 19 was a very good example that showed star learning can actually come to a stop so we need to consider the kind of good digital content that we can have that will ensure that that learning continues even when issues like covet happen happens uh of course we would also need to consider the cost benefit analysis as we consider the type of content we are looking for so most of this information is available in the digital content knowledge pack that will be shared once it's complete now what are these types of content are we looking at so when you're considering the kind of content you want to deploy depending on the infrastructure that you have you could be looking at either the interactive digital content that has all the multimedia facets included in it uh in some instances you look at ebooks and in these cases you'll also look at e-textbooks e-readers and stuff like that depending again on what your situation is uh we can look at audio video content would have radio programs and tv programs that are probably more applicable in the condition and situations that we are in um there are several uh ework books and worksheets that are there gamification is also becoming very important recently where we have content uh packaged in in the form of games where learners can continue engaging in them as they learn various concepts that are that are there in the curriculum we have assessments and tests now going online we we will have a kp that addresses assessments and also we can look at various things uh areas or where we where content is packaged in multimedia um a good example would be animations that are used and simulation simulations in places especially where the laboratories are not available that is a a very common uh a common problem that we find in africa that schools are there they've been set up but there's no there are no resources to set up the labs and all other things that come with the lab so simulations would be a type of
content that you could consider to replace the laboratories or have the them as vascular labs so um when you think about content and the type of content you want to bring in i've mentioned the types that you could think of there are certain other things that you need how do you acquire this content how do you get this content now there are various ways that you can get the content you can either buy that content and the content that is out there for pay is normally referred to in most is normally referred to as commercial content and this content um is available and developed by private sector and other vendors and in it is aligned to the education standards and curriculum and usually it's available through either the subscription model or you may pay a license or one-time fee depending on what the agreement with the vendor is but bottom line is it is very important for us to understand even if you want to buy content do you have the capacity uh or your do your teachers have the capacity to know what is the right content that can be mapped to your curriculum and into the learning environment that you're getting into so whatever it is that you decide to buy then you must consider whether it is aligned to your content uh to your curriculum and the standards that are set and that it is going to play in the devices or the infrastructure that you have set in place the other consideration when you're buying or when you want to acquire content would be some in some organ some countries may decide to build their own content um and this could be advised by several factors that you might decide you do not want to buy content uh because you want content that is really uh developed for your own situation of your own country that is so rigid to your curriculum therefore content that is developed elsewhere might not really work well within uh within your situation so you may decide then to build that content but as you decide to build the content then you must have the capacity to build content in your environment i'll handle that as i mentioned as we move on in another slide it will be very important to check if you have existing in-house capacity to be able to build your own content there are various reasons why people decide to build content vis-a-vis buying content another way of acquiring this content would be to adapt content that is already available this is mainly the open educational resources and these are teaching and learning uh resources uh which are available in any medium either digital or otherwise and that reside in the public domain and they can be accessed under an open license that permits no cost for tests you can use them the way you want you're allowed to do that you can adapt them to fit within your situation and it can be distributed based on what license you are using uh you're using at that point in time so there are certain things that you need to consider when you're when you're looking at content um and especially when you're thinking about buying or building content when you're building content it is important to think about whether you have the technical capacity to build that content in terms of do you have in-house instructional designers do you have content authors do you have subject matter experts do you have the multimedia experts do you have the systems administrators will enable you to put together that content so that you can deploy it for the purpose that it is meant to the other consideration that you could look into when you're deciding to build the content is whether it uh whether the local market is mature and competitive enough to absorb that content that you're going to build you'll also need to look at the cost and benefit analysis whether it makes sense for you to build content visa be buying so on the other side when you're thinking about buying content you have the capacity of the teachers or you do your teachers have the capacity to identify to curate or evaluate that content so that it meets or it fits within the standards and the curriculum in that teaching and learning environment are they able to align that content that they they want to buy to the curriculum that they are using the other one uh that would be important to look into is either the government if they are the ones who are intending to buy whether they have that capacity to work with the vendors to ensure that the content in there is relevant and whether it can be integrated to all tool sets or it is effective and it is appropriately catalogued the other thing that when you're buying content you need to look into is the mechanism to work with the content creators and vendors so that they can you can guide their content to ensure that it is in most cases aligned to their curriculum and it's also to the guy to to the standards that are already set now that is in regards to content where you want to buy it or build it but as i mentioned earlier on you can also get content that is open source that is free and this you when you're thinking about this there's certain things you're looking into are you struggling with designing interventions first to reach content in with affordable content uh for example you have all these children all over the place and you may not have enough resources i could you co considering oel should be one way to go so that you're able to get as much content as possible to reach as many kids as you possibly can so all here could be one of the areas that you'd want to look into it is content that is accessible easily accessible easily adaptable uh to the scenarios that you are into so if if you are looking to if you do not have enough resources or as a country you decided that that is the way to go then you would want probably to look into the oers they are easily available you can get them as and when you require in most cases are easily adaptable to the various uh curricula that that is in existence and as we look on we'll see some of the areas or some of the oers that is available across the world some of the case studies or where this has been used the the digital content has been deployed in any of the formats that are talked about uh peru has done that and they have curated already existing content meaning that they are using the open educational resources although they have also combined in building some of the content which they built because they were it was not in existence so they used the personnel that they had through a project that they had to build content in areas that was not available therefore they they have tried to ensure that they have content that is free and accessible to their learners as well as built in areas that they didn't have another example would be kenya where they through the digital learning uh digital literacy program in all the devices that the country uh the government was able to supply to all the public schools they came in built with content now for kenya they bought content from vendors so they procured content that went into the devices that the learners got so that is another example of the kind of a country that has used commercial content so there are various other countries who have used different approaches and we can look at them as we move along so what is the what are the uh what digital content exists and esther i'll just jump into it you know you are you are over time so we're in the q a uh we're in the q a um session now as well i don't know how many slides you have left but i wanted you to alert you to that we have some questions in the chat about um exactly this uh what kind exists and uh what are some practical strategies and lessons from real experience including kenya okay i only have two slides so this one and the next one uh which i have mentioned about so i will just run through them so on one side i have examples of some lawyers that are common for for example over here and i have attached a link which you can get and probably go run through them we have uh african storybooks that has a whole lot of storybooks that are being used in various languages available in various languages across various countries that can also be used we have the common one that we know the khan academy and then um the commercial content would have like the world reader we have a bongo we have quite a number of others that are there in africa those that we know about we have the world reader that is very common in africa uh bongo is also there in tanzania then we have others who are offering interactive content like musing park tekken mata online and so on and so forth just to underscore this that before you deploy any digital content it's for that to act to it is important to ensure that you have capacity or your teachers have capacity to curate to align the content uh to the uh to the set standards and curriculum because it will not be effective if you have not done that so i want to leave it at that and probably answer the questions that are there uh this slide just talks about some of the practical strategies that we can use um before we deploy digital content so maybe i could leave it at this point and then we could answer the questions that come my colleagues will also help me in answering the questions thank you thanks so much esther esther and arya both have a wealth of uh not only theoretical knowledge about this but very very practical knowledge about what works and what doesn't uh in specific contexts in places especially across um east africa um so we'd be happy to take uh more questions including uh you know a basic question i think that people ask is what kind if we have to choose what type of content uh this may be a good or bad question what what's the most effective content what's the most impactful content that you've seen used in your experiences and and how did you know um adam you want to take that uh that's a that's a kind of a tough question i think the way that we're positioning it in the knowledge pack and more generally is that a mixed a mixed model is really important um so i think what we've seen around oer specifically is that um oer being being sort of a da alliance curriculum being adapted and being used at scale is still at a very nascent stage we have not really seen that across any countries and so um taking sort of an approach where you want to tap in fully to oer really isn't realistic um and at the same time sort of uh taking an approach where uh purchasing um content for pay may also not be sustainable because digital content could be very very expensive so i think um one thing we've sort of landed on is how to create or build a mixed model where uh you're tapping into or purchasing uh digital content for pay but also uh supporting more of and leading into open educational resources um where it makes sense and also supporting that ecosystem so that um uh there is a stronger open educational um uh there's a stronger ecosystem around open educational resources where there's more sharing there's um clear alignment standards uh because that just doesn't really exist right now and so the more practice that happens around that the more quality resources there's going to be but there needs to just be more stakeholders actually doing that esther i don't know if there's anything or ed you want to add to that something that i if you don't mind thank you arium um i do want to suggest that first of all the content that's best is going to be the content that you use whatever that turns out to be it's going to be highest quality content i've talked with teachers in developed countries who say they need to show media they need to show a video or something in class in order to keep the students attention and explain the concept to them there are other kinds of content of course that are important such as azarium suggests approaching with from a mixed model is probably the best um my thought is just it depends on whether you're going to be using it in an only online environment or if you're going to be using it in uh face-to-face in the classroom as well in which case you have the teacher to interface the teacher can say here is an example of a steam engine in this video and explain unpack the example in order to make the video more clear whereas in a remote and independent learning situation the same video may just be water over the bridge if you know what i mean thank you that's all so i would say just to end up that is that uh um in addition to what my colleagues have said content that is aligned to the curriculum and that meets the standard to me would be the most appropriate content because if you take if and that is why i underscored that you need to have the capacity to know what is the right content to curate it against the standards and against the curriculum that you have otherwise it will not have any effect and of course when you have the standards they'll tell you if you're going to use maybe multimedia type of interactive type of content with the standard that the standard will help you know which is the content that has high quality so we will need the two things the standard and the curriculum to determine the type of content or the quality content that you can have and the teachers must have that skill that competency to be able to do that thank you over to you mike thank you so much um esther rm and ed and uh we will hear from ed uh again and arya and esther i think as well shortly we have a number of great questions in the chat um a reminder that this is just a preview of a much larger knowledge pack that addresses all sorts of issues related to digital content and a preview if you will of a much larger training session on this uh topic that will occur uh inside the edtech policy academy we have interesting questions raised in the chat about content for children with special needs this issue of digital content versus offline or print content which are better marguerite cited an oecd study that said well you know the digital content people use that head lower um had a lower impact with them what's up with that um so these are additional things that we can talk about perhaps um in the q a as we go forward in the chat now but we'd like to thank um esther ahrim uh for this preview if you will uh digital educational content and we'd now like to continue with this theme thinking about how all this cont where is it how do you uh keep it where does it reside talking about learning management systems talking about individual pieces of content as part of a larger content system uh with that i'd like to introduce ed gable to talk about lms or learning management systems yes thank you mike i'm going to try to figure out how to share this presentation share and make things work the way i want them to um so learning management systems this has been this presentation has been been developed by myself with as esther gascito from whom you just heard uh john moravec inaudible from the world bank's edtech team um the most important thing i think to understand is can you guys hear me and see me okay first thing yep okay great thanks right um so the most important thing is to understand what a learning management system is it's sometimes known as a virtual learning environment which seems to be a little more uh focused on education than on training and corporate training there's a lot of uses of lms's in corporate situations for corporate training in whether it's onboarding of new employees professional development of existing employees or outreach to clients there are many other uses of lms's for higher education there are to be honest few uses of lms's to resolve the issues of remote or distance education with uh in nationals certainly in national k-12 systems but we will talk a little bit about some possibilities there in a bit so a digital learning management system is primarily the glue between the divine can be seen as the glue between the devices and the digital content it provides students a way to access in an independent circumstance independent of distance education circumstances it had provide students a way to access the content and participate in classes it provides a way for teachers to manage those classes by first creating sequences of digital content and secondly by communicating with students assessing student knowledge yes do you have uh are you projecting your presentation if so we do not see it oh oh i am projecting my presentation i thought i i thought you could see it it says here participants can now see what you were sharing hover over the area above to access controls that you stopped sharing i'm going to are do you have multiple screens are you sharing a different screen i might be um okay let me see what i can do here um i'm going to stop this presentation and remove it can you see the presentation now we cannot know we still see your smiling face well i am so sorry about that um at least i'm smiling um so so i i i just don't i'm kind of stymied i don't know what to say here uh let me see if i can figure out screen sharing and slightly different in use slideshow use slides or swap this [Music] see if i can grab it for you ed and screenshare right but just keep going and in the meantime i'm gonna try to pull it up okay so uh the the other thing that lms's do is that they enable ministries of education to aggregate data about student learning in other words ministries of education can harvest the data from instantiations of lms's in schools and use those to base their curriculum and other decisions on that on those data so mike all i'm seeing is the slides if you're seeing me i don't i don't know what to say um i'm going to go on to the next slide which is uh not a next site it's an animation actually because we this question has come up is google classroom an lms the answer i think that is no what is google classroom it's a free classroom management system widely used in many countries in mostly oecd countries i believe but it's used to communicate with with teachers with sorry for teachers to use it to communicate with students it's used to assign homework to manage classes via quizzes delivery of content and so on and so forth in this with the assumption that there is a strong offline a strong online component that happens outside the classroom in addition google classroom is not a virtual classroom it is uh it provides virtual classrooms will say provide collectively experienced learning in other words they're an online forum or environment where the teacher can conduct basically classroom like uh classroom like activities so um google classroom is a valuable tool and it is free but it is not a learning management system because it doesn't meet the minimum requirements it doesn't allow students to access content it doesn't allow teachers to access content to sequence content and it doesn't allow for teachers to engage with students in a virtual environment it is primarily a supplement to the classroom experienced so i'm going to go on to the next slide area are you are you able to project my slides yeah i think i just need one minute i'm sorry i just i've just pulled it up okay i am no no no worries i am on the slide that says starts out ask why as bob and mike have said we're going to be this problem this question is extraordinarily important and i think what we find is when we ask what is the problem to be solved we find that digital learning management systems are primarily viable in two instances one is to support distance learning um which could be it's typically considered to be nationwide learning in k-12 in k-12 school environments and that can or could include geographically marginalized students it could include students who are otherwise unable to come to school or to access the resources that are used in school because they have low vision or low audio capacity or so on and so forth so in other words via lms's could be used for to increase inclusivity it could also be used to prepare the school system for the next closure resulting from a pandemic from a disaster or from a conflict in order in other words beefing up its the school system's capacity to deliver remote distance education sorry um and finally the most most this enables this enables the adaptation for you know proximal closure would be the opportunity to reach students or teachers system-wide providing students with online access to learning throughout the country or provide teachers with access to training in say standards or in the use of content or in the use of digital devices finally the lms can be used to support in-class learning typically what would happen as i'm as i think i mentioned in the content discussion the teacher can run may want to run a video three or four times in a given classroom in order to adam braid the uh learning that is being that is being you know supported by the video um but in terms of in terms of the use of learning management systems sometimes those become the use of flipped classrooms in other words students access the content at home they watch the video perhaps they do an interactive simulation they take an assessment then they come to class and they discuss so they meet with the teacher who is primarily working as a facilitator to help the students unpack the problems that they have already experienced in relation to the digital content i'm going to move on to the next slide which is that you all as as as ttls need to uh start preparing your clients to interact with sales reps engineers and others and you need to interact with the moe personnel we'll talk about what some of the main questions are in a moment um the most important things to do and to see that are done i think of the development of use cases so that you have a bulletproof understanding of who when how and why students and teachers will use a given lms uh how they'll access it what devices they'll be using will they be a full screen device like a laptop will it be a smaller screen device like a smartphone will it be via connectivity that is subsidized or is it by the government will it be zero rated by the telecommunications operator those are all questions that need to be answered before you begin development of the lms you need to know who how what when and why among other things and you use the use cases to develop a software requirement specification which helps you prioritize the main the functions and characteristics of the vendor's platform if you or if you're developing a new platform can help you say this characteristic this function is present this function is substandard this function we don't need so much um and then ultimately the srs should be vetted by all stakeholders and the output of the srs the adaptation of the learning management system should also be vetted by all stakeholders i'm moving on to the next slide which suggests one of the key questions for lms evaluation the first question is is the interface easy to use one of the findings that we had from the discussion with the malaysia team i believe is that their teachers lack digital skills and that is an extraordinarily difficult thing to accommodate you need to provide training to the teachers first of all but you need to also make sure that the interface is not engaging the teachers in multiple operations to log in in multiple operations to access the content in multiple operations to sequence a context content then you want to know other questions you might want to know are what the factors are that affect the number of concurrent users what is the anticipated load of users all students are accessing content at the same time is that happening are they all doing it after school are all doing it during school how does that affect the number of concurrent users that are being tasking the ministry of education servers or the cloud servers of the provider um how is that is that is there a load test that is being conducted to let you know that your system is simplifying or delaying some of the calls to the server so that there's no jam up of over of too much denial of service basically um and then the questions the question i think is to what extent are there schools teachers and students who are offline or will be using the tool offline what kinds of accommodation do you make for those there are several basically open source lms's that are available in off the grid solutions one of these is moodlebox which is has been deployed i think john my colleague john knows more about moodle box than i do by far um moodlebox has been deployed in i think 12 countries and colibri which has been deployed in more countries and includes content from the khan academy and others they clearly specializes in just delivery of uh off-the-grid content that is accessible in schools and to a certain extent by users outside of schools although their work they have yet to finalize that development i believe so then i think one of the key questions as esther pointed out in the content discussion is how are you going to develop or customize the content that populates this lms so one idea is to be sure that the the some author authoring tools are included in lms's and i think you want to make sure that there are efficiency hacks if you will um available in the lms these could include tools and templates that enable you to reuse content that you have in development that enable you to tag content effectively uh that enable you to develop content based on prior content i think you also want to ask the main the main question i think is to be sure that there are instructional designers involved in both the coordination of the content and in the uh coordination and development of the localization of the content and in the development of the content the design and development of the content itself you so you want to make sure in terms of coordination you want to make sure that all parts of the curriculum are being supported that need to be supported in terms of development you want to make sure that the content can be again can be developed efficiently it can be linked to the curriculum can be found in the learning management systems repository and then uh finally um you want to make you want to find out what that you want to make sure there is support for data and analysis you want to make sure that you're understanding whether the lms will be used on-site in classrooms or only for remote learning i'm going to move on to the next slide okay and ed i think ed we are just about we're about at time here do you want to get in the evening i i do thank you i'm i'm gonna just i'm gonna be almost done here um there are other design factors addressed in the k in the lms knowledge pack some of these we've talked about already some of them are addressed extensively like hosting um we talk a little bit about assessment we'll talk more about assessment tomorrow in terms of open source versus commercial i think that what we see are there are several deployments there's a good mix in the in the market of open source solutions moodle and canvas are both open source um there's a good mix of of lms commercial and open source providers there are more instantiations of moodle in k-12 uh providing in terms of national k-12 systems such as in malia and cabo verde as the so as the slide suggests and there are a number in africa of there are i think three uh moodle customization companies that are required because i think it's important to note that even with an open source lms the cost of customization the costs are about even they they make they do that to you uh the costs are about even between customization of an open source lms and procurement of a license for a uh proprietary lms i think you need to determine what your real requirements and needs are that is the end of it there is a list of of additional thank you very much there is a list of additional lms's at the end of this uh presentation and i think that does it for me i'll be happy to take any questions thank you very much ed and um arya minister uh sorry to cut you off i'd like to go jaime salvedra has joined us and he has a question about uh digital educational content um in general i may over to you uh thank you very much uh mike uh and thank you very much for this presentation super useful i have a couple questions first to the uh um on the previous uh presentation on digital content on the digital content discussion um it was said that teachers have to be prepared to use any digital content that is bought and it has to be aligned um to the um to the curriculum um my question is i mean do in which way do um uh commercially available um software in general but what would be um particular regarding that things that one can buy what would be a good example right of countries who have been able to deploy at scale right digital content that can be that can be uh that can be bought and actually that we can say yes and it was well aligned to the curriculum they have any examples in the global south um i would say that it's not classified right in which there's uh a good um in integration of commercially bought um software or any type of contact with the current curriculum right and related related to that um for any of our ttls right between oer and um and um commercially available uh software what would be the best thing to explore first right i mean in the end in the second case in the case of i mean commercial content is always we have to handle the issue of procuring that so which which way would be better to explore first and my second question is on on this issue of the lms again what would be a good example right of a recent deployment of a new lms system that that is really able to integrate um allow to manage the system and how to manage the classroom and in integrate different different software solutions and my my worries that usually when when uh when when we decide that okay so we need to revamp in the system in any country there's already stuff happening today there might be an lms somewhere there is some digital contact they don't talk to each other but still you need to build on what exists right so what would be a good example in which building or what exists today but there has been there has been um a good deployment of a new lms system at scale over to you uh mike thanks tommy i think so jaime into the the team jaime raises some uh some first order and fundamental questions about thinking about digital educational content i recognize that we have uh um jp and agatha already queued up to go uh for the emes we could have one minute quick response to jaime now and we can follow up with more information a reminder that this is a preview of a of very large knowledge packs around educational content and a preview of a much longer in-depth uh sessions at the edtech policy academy that we'll debut later this year we have just one minute quickly to address one key uh response uh to humming's question that we'd like to move to uh jp and agatha i'll let aryam esther or ed fight as to who wants to respond to jaime here esther do you want to give an example of how kenya's used commercial content and then maybe we can talk about how oer has been mobilized to fill in some of the gaps and we can talk about one minute's worth because we have different agatha really okay i'll just uh be very quick thank you thank you um kenya did i mentioned it in the chat i tried to answer it in the chat um the way kenya is structured the policies that are there instructional materials development is a liberal market where other people can develop and government's role is to check for quality and approve that material therefore in regards to the digital content especially for the new curriculum that is coming to place uh in the digital literacy program the country actually bought content for all the learners in all the primary schools the primary schools are about 25 000 schools and the learners are 1.2 so all the children who and the devices were supposed to be one on one to one of this for these kids so the each of these devices came with content and this content was procured by the government from the vendors or those content creators who have done and they have continued to do that uh they did that for grade one they've done for grade two currently now they are procuring content for grade three and uh are not grade five four because they've already done one two and three and next year they'll be doing for grade five so as the curriculum develops further then they are they acquire the con the procure content for them in that regard previously they had built content especially for the high high school that built content in all the areas but again because of that policy where
and the way they built content then is that there are no content there are no vendors who are willing to go into digital content and therefore government through kcd built content for high schools at that point in time now that they have decided to the the the the public the private is uh the private companies are now building for digital content now government cannot build so they can only buy because of the policy that is there that exist thank you thank you sir i think we'll have to wrap the session up here and that uh what esther's described at kenya where you have uh adoption and adaption uh adaptation of oer content development of content internally and then increasingly as markets become more mature being able to go out and buy and market is a typical way that many countries um have the typical life cycle of the usage and development usage of digital educational content unfortunately this is again just a preview of a much more in-depth discussion around these topics that uh will take place and a much more in-depth knowledge pack on this that is um being drafted as well and shared this summer with that i'd like to thank uh the team uh ed um rm and esther and i'd like to go to uh jp and agatha looks like maybe agatha is first emis 2.0 again this is a just a real quick set of highlights about a topic that we i think all of us in education have what's bianna struggled with over time over to you um agatha and jp okay thanks michael jp are you on um do you hear me because i don't hear jp we hear you again and we see your um we see your slides right okay so jp do you hear me okay all right so i'm not sure where jp is um but we'll get started he emailed me though a minute or so ago um regarding co-presenting so i'm not sure if something has gone wrong he's corrected oh he's connecting okay all right maybe just give him a couple seconds as he connects maybe i'll just do the first couple slides to introduce us to the topic so the topic is emis 2.0 um also known as a learning and accountability system architecture so you'll see through the slides we will reference this acronym lassa and you know if you keep wondering what it is um this is what it is learning and accountability system architecture um next slide we intend to quickly cover um these eight sub-topics um the overall knowledge pack is over 150 pages of detailed toolkits that can be used so what we have here about nine slides where we give a high level overview of you know some of the questions that we were trying to address and where you can get a little bit more information jp are you here do you want to start or should i go ahead okay i don't hear you but um the minute you're here then let me know and then i'll stop speaking so we created this ms2.oh knowledge pack um and what it is is a practical toolkit for ministries of education and the reason we created it was to help guide ministries of education on how to effectively think about both the design and deployment of systems technology and process the emphasis here is on the design um a couple slides later we'll go through what the roadmap should look like for any country that's looking to deploy an email system a huge emphasis is put on the design the bulk of the work um for this to be successful must be in the design phase and and we provide a lot of toolkit to support countries to do that um the focus of the design is to integrate where countries are today with where they want to be in the future so you know different countries are in different places and we are able to you know communicate to them what the ideal end state is but also taken into consideration the fact that these countries cannot just jump there within a very short period of time so the toolkit helps provide them with a roadmap of how to eventually get there um and and the whole design is focused on using enterprise architectural principles so ea principles are industry global industry standards that you know have been used in the it world for the last 20-15 years but have not necessarily been implemented in education settings and as a result there have been a lot of challenges faced by schools and ministries as they try and put all these devices software applications together um so the whole focus of emis 2.0 is bringing in enterprise architectural principles to pull in all those different systems okay next slide jp are you here should i go on okay all right so what is our motivation um emis 2.0 um the whole entire knowledge pack has been created to support ministries sorry did you speak can you guys hear me yes can you hear me okay great sorry i've been listening all along it's just that i'm having problems with uh my internet sorry you can carry on you can carry on um uh i gotta i just want one brief point on on on the the our interpreter architecture and what you've mentioned about not being used in education and just highlight that it actually social protection and health these principles are being used so so it's not that the public sector are not familiar with those but uh in in some sectors these are this is a language that is becoming more natural mr protection um and and in health to some extent as well and and even in our among our colleagues in the bank uh several of our uh social protection operations today are actually using these principles when they are designing systems with government so please i get to carry on okay all right so how can emis 2.0 support ministries so you know there's many different ways that this knowledge pack is able to effectively support ministries but we focus here on four of them the first one is helping support data driven decision making so an email system that's designed using the ems 2.0 principles can provide the right kind of data that can guide leaders on how to manage learning laws um guide gauge dropout risk and encourage re-enrollment specifically now as we come out of the pandemic and learn and move from home learning to face-to-face learning secondly an effectively deployed email system can help correct some of the flaws with the existing data systems that some of the ministries already have in place so majority of the countries are already collecting lots of different data but this data because of lack of data governance which we found as a recurring issue in many countries the data cannot really be used by the ministries to actually drive decisions so when effectively deployed ems 2. system can help correct some of these issues um what we've seen is that within the last few years a lot of ministries of education are producing a lot of data so the capacity to produce the data far outstrips their ability to then read use analyze this data and use it to actually drive decisions an effectively deployed ems 2.0 system can be integrated with analytics and dashboards to help support this kind of data usage for decision making and the last piece is driving consistency of data across all the different departments that are producing data within the education agency so an effectively designed ems will ensure that there's the right data governance and interoperability between all these different systems so the policies are in place ensuring that stipulate how data will be stored used managed and accessed okay i will move to the next slide so you know we're talking about emis 2.0 and we've all heard about enus before so i just wanted to give a quick overview of what traditional amos is and what amos 2.0 should look like so traditional amos which we refer to as emis.1.0 look like the diagram we have here at the bottom right so these systems and processes will focus on essentially having periodic one-way transfer of data of from student information from the schools to the central government so typically we would have schools collect this data um on paper and pencil and then when those forms were all gathered they would go into a central office and they would be keyed into an ems system the the data collected would essentially be demographic data so age gender enrollment dropout rates and some level of assessment data um what we had there was a one-way transfer of data right so there was no feedback back to the schools who were actually responsible for gathering and collecting this data so the data was essentially collected for reporting purposes you know so the ministry wants to understand how many peoples there are so that they can understand how to correctly allocate their resources um in majority of cases there were no analytics or early warning systems that were incorporated into these systems to actually guide decision making and improve student outcomes um and you know the end result from a lot of studies has been that this sort of setup typically results in below average results for the ministry of education investment so they invest in this amis expecting that it will drive results but because it's not set up to do that um there's no results other than the inputs that were provided on paper from the schools so that's traditional email system jp do you want to jump in for this slide you're mute sorry guys your computer is just can you hear me yeah oh great um okay so you want me to go ahead okay all right so now this is the definition of what emis 2.0 so we've gone over what the initial traditional emis looked like so aim is 2.0 learning and accountability system architecture is essentially an end-to-end architectural design of a comprehensive education data system so it's not just the amos component but it includes any other component within the education system that either produces or consumes or modifies data enos 2.0 the knowledge pack that we've created provides countries with the checklist and workflow toolkits between these systems that we've described to support the implementation of a really robust education data system which meets high independent standards and and what we mean by that is that it meets ea architectural principles and is designed with the goal of providing the catalyst for positive change in the education sector so quickly to the next slide just a quick overview of differentiating the two systems so we've talked about what enus 1.0 is and what amos 2.0 is these five main areas are what differentiate the two right so the first one is data governance with the ems 2.0 there's very clear data policies and checklists put into place to support the ministry of education so that there's an assurance of data integrity across all the different education departments that are creating or producing data or consuming that data there's an inter interoperability of systems across the education agency so whether it's an lms or whatever systems that the ministry has put into place we define um again a global international standard of interoperability so that there is no vendor lock-in because one vendor brings in one system that does not interpret with any other system data architecture across all these systems is also designed and mandated and ministries of education will be provided with the toolkits to be able to do that um identity management is strongly recommended because having that in place then supports being able to track the students you know right from kindergarten up until higher education there's a focus on microservices and sort of monolithic systems that do very many things um and the last piece is a focus on the effectiveness in the analysis and dissemination of finding so we saw in the previous diagram that with emis 1.0 the focus is on collection of the data but there was very little emphasis on you know let's analyze what the data is saying to us and let's disseminate these findings in order to drive continuous school improvement um let's use this data for decision making that was not part of the mandate with traditional email systems but is mandated in ims 2.0 so very quick overview of what a system like this can look like so this is just a very high level picture so number one here we have microsoft service architecture so systems are built to share data um but they handle a single functionality so we have a student information system collaboration tools lms all of these but they are all singular systems and they are joined here but they're interconnected where there's access to a central data lake um or data warehouse which centrally manages this shared data moa leaders principals teachers parents have access to this data through pre-built dashboards um where they're able to then pull out specific reports to be able to review specific performance and these reports help inform instruction and reallocation of resources effectively and they drive the programs that are then created for continuous school improvement and this forms the feedback loop back to the schools so this is a really high level picture of what an ems 2.0 um system should look like okay if i if i may and jp jump in we are so we are at the 12 and a half minute mark for the 10 minute presentation and i know we want to get to uh um some questions as well and then jaime will be uh we'll need to wrap it up and he needs to go as well and we apologize to everyone uh that we are treating uh all these very uh complicated topics uh so quickly but again this is meant to be a high level overview of some key messages from a much uh larger set of work that is ongoing so maybe let me let me come in here uh i got to just to wrap it up on on the emmys and and kind of focus on on this slide and maybe the our last slide in terms of how we've been working with teams so colleagues can can understand so if you go back to the road map i think that's an important element uh i think the the diagram that agataph showed is the end state of of a vision of what an m 2.0 can be of course for us the clinical critical part of this is the the technology maturity of each one of our clients and we understand that none of them are exactly at the same place so we want to meet them where they are and for that the way we we've envisioning uh and this is part of the the knowledge back is this architecture roadmap in which in the first year of the engagement there's this several products or or or tools in which we want to use with our clients uh to precisely identify where they are and where they want to get and what are the business needs right that they have and those are the critical elements for the design and the and to inform the rfp or the the contract that the procurement process right for vendors that that can serve uh this particular product because we are using this this architectural approach right the idea is that the rfv becomes a lot easier to be done and a lot more concrete for vendors to to apply to and we are using very much kind of industry standards which again helps again uh future proof the the investment right and make sure that that whatever is being uh purchased it doesn't necessarily create a vendor lock-in um year two is when basically the the development of of the procurement starts and and of course with uh with piloting and testing of of the system and and creation of of training material on how to use the system and and by year three we would envision a a full-scale uh rollout and and of course uh this would be a a continuous process right in which the system would be improved as we go but i think one critical element is to assess the technology maturity of the client identify where they are very concretely and what would it take uh for them to be in year two three four right and and this is thinking very much of the life cycle of the of our projects and our dialogue and if you go to the last uh slide agatha please the we have already engaged with a few teams in guyana at the state in nigeria morocco niger vietnam and i think the the approach has always been to first start with a conversation with ttls to explain the the vision and and the problems that we're trying to solve with with this particular approach in most cases this uh actually led very quickly to a to a conversation with the client in order to explain this the same principles to the client and and most clients actually of all clients that we've engaged uh have have found this head that this would really resonate with them edo state morocco or two in which we are now in active dialogue with with the client and and really moving from uh from a sensitization to an engagement right with the ttls with the teens uh in which we're basically bringing in these principles and help shape the the the program around these elements so i'll stop here for for questions and yeah next steps thanks so much jp and agatha uh noting that we're almost out of time uh there are there are lots of questions that have come in and if we're not able to get to them all today these are things we'll follow up with people um offline and that we'll be exploring in greater depth at the policy academy i note that ruth asked a very specific and pertinent question related to links between the dashboard work uh dashboards and and emus uh what they might be equa asked a question i think that many people have about do you should you have a national level emis an institutional level emas is it different if you're talking about k-12 versus higher ed and uh whom i just talked about you know the struggles of uh in in rwanda and these are repeated elsewhere of you know how how can ministries be incentivized to update and improve their emis systems uh once they're actually in place and the money's been spent oftentimes they've said that's been solved and those are three quick questions if you have jp agatha uh very quick responses uh to those and then we'll go to hello and jaime to uh conclude us for the day absolutely so on the on the relation between this uh vision and and the dashboard right i think it's uh there are certain elements which are uh definitely a line right but there are some critical differences as well in the sense that the dashboard is a survey right so it's a sample-based survey here we're talking about the administrative uh system of the ministry of education in which in general most school senses most of these records are actually uh census-based right so so there is a difference at sk of the scale there's also a difference of the frequency right because if the vision of an m is 2.0 is that if it rolled out or when rolled out data will come as part of the regular business transactions of the ministry so the the frequency of data the quantity of data also changes now there are certain elements of this which you could think of of natural links between the dashboard work and this i mean the dashboard work it can be seen very much as an r d element in order to identify uh types of visualizations types of questions that maybe the ministry might want to actually roll out at scale in a in an administrative based system such as what the ms 2.0 can can provide the dashboard can also work as a as a quality control of of the admin data so basically you can you can use the data that comes from the dashboard to triangulate with what you're getting out of the admin records of course not for all variables because the dashboard certainly would include more variables than most admin systems but for certain critical variables you could use the the data from the dashboard to triangulate with the data from an ms system and this vision of an ms 2.0 of an integrated data system uh but the critical difference is the how the data is collected right in the dashboard it's a survey uh in this one we're really thinking of transactional data that is generated but through the regular processes of the ministry uh which most of our ministers most of our clients are generating data as part of their processes right payments data to transfer of resources to schools so on and so forth uh i think touching very quickly on on the other question of an ms system i think that it probably makes sense to think of this by by at least between k-12 and higher education as two separate systems given that the the needs are can be quite different i think having a student id that allows the linking and the tracking of and tracing of students throughout your educational life it's something that is more and more feasible uh and that should be i think an aspiration for most of the systems but uh they don't need to be uh there's no need to have a single system i think that part of the the value of this architectural approach and the microservices is that there are going to be certain functions which can be repurposed through all grades in all segments of educational systems and others are going to be very specific specific to particular uh uh segments so i think and and that is the value of the microservices is that you can modularize your your functions and fit and use them as needed throughout and combine them as needed as well um and i'll stop here thank you thanks so much jp thanks agatha and uh um thanks to all of our presenters today and the edtech team and geek and alex uh for orchestrating this uh all and lorelei as well um thanks also to the folks who have participated in the chat not only with questions but with solutions back and forth thanks ruth just one of many showing that we are resources for each other here on these topics as with others tomorrow we will have an additional four topics that we'll address very quickly on a digital assessment on uh technology and literacy on teacher skills for remote learning and for tutoring and remedial learning so we'll have another quick fire session on four very broad topics as well um that will preview the knowledge packs and the learning academy um now i'd like to uh turn to i don't know if halal or jaime which will go first or hello did you want to go before jaime or should thanks mike thank you so much today it's excellent presentations as mentioned this pack agenda we have a lot to cover in a short period of time in fact i will discuss with the team to have a comeback again on maybe separate topics uh just i think today's discussion on ms by itself will take health day maybe more a time to discuss to operationalize and also the content depends on the the country we work was given an example but we cannot implement this in every single country this needs to come from also the client so i would like to give the context actually so each topic will take time i think this is today just to start discussion this is an important agenda uh we are very happy to have me to conclude actually this is part of our discussion at the global level but also in the africa region uh i would like to the team also start to think about also the use of technology i think the first part was quite interesting for me also the selection of devices the selection of the content there are different uh obviously the the content we can use so each topic really it's specialized we think and we know we think we know also but when you get into detail in terms of the operationalization of each topic really takes time so i'm very happy to have the team today uh the on the msa jp and the team and the uh the on each topic i should be very able to cover so i we will continue to discuss tomorrow one and how far uh the question i will really ask the rtts also how to operationalize how to recharge information because it's really technical if you don't know how to ask the right question we don't need to know everything i mean i'm not an emmy specialist but i should know enough to ask the right question as the detail to advise the government the same thing for the selection of the devices we don't need to know everything you know how the tablet is organized i have two tablets here in front of me i don't know details but i should be able to discuss really which device would be good if the ministry of education country x they ask or we would like to provide god bless every single student that is the technical question we should be able to ask but we should be able to bring the technical support i mean we have a great team here but also we can reach out to other people outside the bank uh to bring the expertise to advise our client countries because that's at the end what we try to provide uh support our client jamie would you like to conclude please for today thanks so much thank you very much hallelujah and uh and thanks um to the um to the presenters to to agatha frederico um jp i i've learned a lot and and i just want to say two things one is piggybacking on what you just mentioned um a little yes we need to make sure that all our details have the capacity i mean not everyone has to be an expert on all these issues but we need to know enough in order to be able to engage with the uh with our client uh countries my my the challenge that i see is that we need to do two things to continue increasing the capacity of our teams but also to increase the capacity of um of our government counterparts right we need both things to happen at the same time so um what i wanted to ask the 55 people that are still connected here is uh is to give us ideas what else that would be needed to do that better right so we're having this this type of engagement we're having a learning academy that will i mean we're pushing to deploy it as fast as as possible we have the knowledge packs oh that's great right what else is needed in order to increase our our and our country uh counter cards uh counterparts capacity and just to close i mean i think it is really critical that we move um faster in that frontier uh on on technology because i mean nobody here has to be convinced about the magnitude of the challenge that we face in everywhere i would say everywhere in the in the planet even more so in in africa so my sense is that technology with all the caveats and all the challenges um and still knowing that we need to work a lot on the uh and the human factor of teachers technology is what will allow us to make um to move forward much faster so technology is the difference b is the difference between being 2021 and having this same problem 30 years ago right so now we have tools that we didn't have 30 years ago so then we don't need we don't need to wait for another 10 years to see a change at the country level that can happen in a few years the technology exists by the deployment and the design and the adaptation of that technology that's the challenge that we have that we have um uh today but to to to work on that we really need to increase capacity both in the bank and uh in our in our counterparts so any ideas that you guys have um in terms of what else uh should be done or you we can do please let your manager or or myself directly should just shoot me an email and let me know what else we can do so thank you very much to everyone for the team to to organize that this is great uh and let's keep on going over to you uh mike thanks jaime thanks hello thanks to the 54 people who are still with us apologies for going a little bit over today even though we've been working remotely for over a year now we still have technical challenges but we all work through them together we look forward to uh tomorrow sharing and talking with you about digital assessment about literacy and technology about teaching skills for remote learning uh tutoring and remedial learning with that we'll end today's session thanks so much we'll be following up with some of you are directly in response to questions we did not get to uh feel free to reach out to all of us and have a great day thanks so much everyone thanks bye-bye thank you thanks for everyone
hello everybody I'm Kristy Amica I'm with Gateway Academy and I'm moderating today's webinar I wanted to thank the microfinance gateway team for hosting us and thanks to all of you for joining us today as we share early lessons from Gateway Academy on what to consider when launching an e-learning program so before we get started we have just a few logistical items that we wanted to go over with you just letting you know that this is an audio broadcast so your microphones will be muted during the entire webinar session if you want to ask us a question and please do we welcome those use the chat box on the right-hand side of the session and you can submit those throughout the whole presentation I'll be collecting them and we'll make sure to have lots of time for Q&A at the end to make sure that your question is seen by me please select all participants from the drop-down menu when you're sending your question and I also wanted to let you know that the recording of this will be emailed to everybody when we're done the other thing I did want to tell you is that we're going to be asking you just a few questions using our poll feature so please do take a moment and answer those for us so during today's webinar you're going to hear from Gateway Academy's Josephine key Bay and then also from Cal Cena say mo from AP bank Zambia from quake uu aqua from fidelity bank Ghana thank you very much to both of you for being here with us today so first Josephine is going to give us a quick overview of what gateway Academy is to provide some context for today's session after that tao-tsay will share a be Banks experience in starting an e-learning program and then quake GU will share about fidelity banks a Academy's journey then will hand it back over to Josephine to share some early lessons that Gateway academies learned on launching eLearning throughout the different financial institutions that were working with and then finally we'll finish with some Q&A so we're handing it over to Josephine now and you will see just a few quick questions on the right hand side if you can take a moment and answer those but we'll move ahead with the presentation while you're doing that you you you you you you go ahead Josephine you so Thank You Christy for this I can't I would like to remind all the participants that for those who have questions to ask please feel free to put your questions on the chat function and we will be able to answer at the end of this presentation I can see from the poll results that most of us know what the gap is but for the benefit of those who don't know what we do I'll provide a few details of what c-cup what we do at the gap so see gap is a partnership of party for international development organizations and we are housed at the World Bank and our vision at Cedars is to receive to provide for a world where everyone has access to and can use financial services to better their lives therefore our mission is to improve the lives of the poor by encouraging innovations that advanced knowledge are responsible and provide sustainable inclusive financial markets so what is gateway Academy Jeju Academy is an innovative project that has been developed and implemented by sigue in partnership with MasterCard foundation currently we work in 7 African countries we are in Kenya Uganda Tanzania Malawi Zambia and Ghana and these are the focused countries that you are beginning with in our project but we foresee ourselves moving into other countries and we've had interest from countries such as Botswana Namibia Nigeria and our vision is to move into francophone Africa so in order for us to understand exactly what Gateway Academy is I'll provide a background onto the research that has gone through before beginning of this project so we appreciate the fact that a capacity gap exists in Financial Inclusion amongst five financial service providers policy makers and other stakeholders and this gap may really relate to the entry and middle level staff members in this financial studies provide providers institutions also through our research we have noticed that the capacity building market is not working sufficiently to meet the needs of these financials and providers is broken and therefore it becomes cumbersome for financial service provides providers when they are looking for training for their staff members of course we understand that for a financial service provider the aim of having a good training is to increase the effectiveness of capacity building by optimizing the training budget that they have and for us training service provider the aim is to their aim is to increase access to the market so that they can be able to increase their revenue and be able to develop content that will be that will be needed by the financial service providers that will be useful for the financial service provider but as it stands now the market is broken for a training service provider looking to expand their market they have to go and search for financial service providers who would consumers of their content and in the other hand for financial service provider leads leading content they have to go into the market to search for those training service providers that can provide content that is relevant for financial inclusion for their institution and therefore for us at Gateway Academy we are bathing our work on the following elements we are from we are providing an online learning platform we're training service providers will be able to upload content easily and financial service providers will be able to access that content easily we are providing an avenue where there is market facilitation whereby demand and supply can lead to the demand for content from the support from the financial service providers can meet with a supply of content from the training service providers also we are looking at providing curated content content that is organized content that is relevant for financial inclusion we are also providing training service provider capacity-building and this is for those training service providers that see the value and benefit of having their content online we are providing capacity to make sure that that is possible and again for the financial service providers capacity building we are providing content that is relevant that is necessary for those institutions that deal with financially inclusive market so our aim is to bring together training service providers and financial service providers so that a financial service provider that you looking into acquiring content has many options and can approach different training service providers and also a training service provider that is looking into expanding its market has access to many financial service providers that can access this content and therefore we see ourselves as much as facilitators when Gateway Academy is the link between financial service providers looking for content and training service providers who are willing and able to provide content that is necessary for financial inclusion and that is our logo and so the work that we have done so far in from 2016 till now we've divided our work into phases we began with the our third space whereby we approached different trainings of service providers to provide bite-sized content that we could test in for financial circle in our forecast countries so part of the reason why we had Alfa was to involve the stakeholders right from the beginning so that they own the platform they own the content and and therefore they'll see the need and the value for them to engage with us for those courses that were successful they moved into the demo phase where by now he had full courses delivered on our new platform we went out to our partner institutions and they tested these courses and those courses that were successful moved on to the dataset beta phase where we are now where we have full courses that are delivered on our fully functional platform class right from the beginning this has been a collaborative and a co-creation initiative so we have been bold our stakeholders right from the beginning the picture that you see on the screen is our first workshop in Nairobi in June 2016 whereby we brought together financial service providers training service providers and other called us from our focused country to start thinking about how we can shape the direction and the vision for our Academy so I would like to invite taozi from a bee bank to share with us the effort and the initiatives that a bee back has taken in this L in this field so welcome Tulsi thank you very much justice in I'll run you through the opening journey as a bank Zambia so everybody's part of the holding group that is present in ten different countries six of which are in Africa so everybody was established in 2011 and currently has seven branches six of which are in the capital and one is in another city every bank has 450 staff around 400 staff and what this means is our recruitment strategy has been to recruit fresh graduate from university and usually these do not have prior work experience this is why we decided to think of better solutions with regards to training so elearning became very important for us looking at how much we had to invest in in training our staff and also building capacities within the institution so we thought this is a solution because of the many benefits attached to it our time efficiency most of the time we deliver face-to-face training and we'll write our staff from different branches and they have to take an hour or two to travel to the head office to receive such training so if it is the one or two days training it means they'll be away from from their workstations and they will be attending training so we thought by delivering most trainings online our staff would have enough time also to execute their duties other than spend most of their time in class so this is also effective in terms of cost because now we would have to spend less on transportation we spend less on accommodation we have to spend less also on stationery that we print out that we give participants in face to face to trainings another benefit for our learners is they can choose what to learn and wait to learn so with learning the more content that can be provided and participants are able to to choose what type of courses they would like to take and they can take these these courses whenever they are free they take the courses it at their homes though during weekends so the the e-learning content is available they can access it at using different gadgets we also thought this is the best approach being a part of a holding group most of our processes standardized so with real learning it would be much easier to exchange knowledge transfer of knowledge from one bank to another as well as delivering training it will be more cost effective if the if the content is provided online then looking at our average age group in our institution most of the staff are just coming from universities they're very young and they're very eager to new innovations so elearning is something that is exciting to them and we think this is the best approach for such a target for such a target group and most of them like currently in the branches they have whatsapp tubes that they're constantly using every now and then so if they can access learning also from their mobile devices this would make it more effective so what we have done so far we started this we started the discussions of relating in 2015 with the gap and we have been with them in the different stages of development of the Gateway Academy we have so far taken three different courses with them and initially our main priority area was digital financial services which is a training need that we identified as an institution and also we had helix Institute which was paired with us because they were providing us with this content so they also came on ground and they conducted training needs assessment in order to contextualize the training as well as identify the right target group so with this they were able to to provider to the right content we had 25 people that had enrolled for this for this course in April 2017 and we had another training so for the one that we did that was delivered in April 2017 it was delivered in a course of one week we had another training on this the financial services delivered in June so this one was more comprehensive it was a five weeks program and we had two participants that took the course we had another training that was delivered by Strathmore University through the Gateway and through the through collaborations with C gap so this was put for 15 branch managers and heads of department so this was a blended learning course it was a half-day face-to-face training and online training so our journey has not been smooth we had of course some hick taps since we decided to implement learning in our institution and some of some of the thoughts way around having inadequate computers in our institution so right now the set up is not everybody has individual computers that they connected that they can easily access so some of the staff have shared computers such shared computers which of course would not be possible for them to take for example a 5 weeks course easily so this was one of the challenge and we did we thought as an institution to set up and a lab which has been set up in the head office other than this of course this is not the main solution because either ways they have to come to the head office to access this content but also we thought of providing computers in the branches so this is something that we are still trying to implement that now our staff are using their own mobile devices or their own personal laptops to access the content but we are also thinking in terms of providing some computers that would be designated to be learning another challenge was limited internet access in as much as we have our stuff with designated computers to them they do not have internet access due to the nature of business being in a bank so there very few people that have access to the Internet so with this we we sat down with our management team with our IT team and we were able to grant access to the learners directly to the today elearning platform so this somehow was able to mitigate the challenge of limited internet access and also we had [Music] we have inadequate local capacity to support eLearning initiative so this is something that we are looking especially for the future are we able to are we going to be able to manage this on our own are we going to be able to also develop our own content or upload it onto the gateway platform so this is something that we are we are thinking of in terms of building capacities within the bank to have somebody that is going to be developing content to have somebody that is also going to be following up with learners so it's already something that we are already discussing then the other the other challenge that we had is of course the where number of content of how staff would now spend more time on their computers doing the process rather than work so this is not this of course is something that we cannot easily monitor but also the the performance management system is is very clear and also most of the staff have qualitative targets so it's easy to to follow up and it's easy for us to really see if staff are spending more time on computing applause and unload so we still think even if they're spending more time on completing the courses it has a positive effect to their performance then the other challenge that we had is bandwidth limitation we we did anticipate that from the beginning before even rolling out any online for sale so for this we had deliberately carried out a bandwidth test which somehow gave us positive result that we could we could easily have success in the in the program so however when we did the first test when we tested the first code I think it had higher bandwidth requirements so most of the most of the delivery mode was was the mainly videos so our staff had connectivity issues so most of the time the videos were interrupted some videos were also not able to to be viewed so for this one in this it will something that we erased the concern and in the second course that we took it was the light kind of delivery mode there were no videos I think it was something that was easily and is not experienced any connectivity issues the other challenge is how to change the mindset of our staff because they used to face-to-face classroom so now you are introducing them to e-learning does it mean they don't have to travel to Germany for example because we have a training program where we we send our staff to Germany and of course they excited to travel so now how to to change the mindset now say you can now have this course delivered via the platform instead of having to travel and getting your ppm so for this one of course we try to communicate and sell it in a very positive sense it's not completely replacing all face-to-face trainings it's something that can reduce so for example for a program that that would take two years for example and you have to travel like four times in two years to Germany is something that can be reduced with to two times and some of the content can be provided on the platform so this is something that they staff understand and if a training for example also could take one week or two days classroom training some of the content can be delivered online such that it's only reduced to half a day so this made this makes positive sense for them because they also have targets that they have to fulfill and then they realize that it's actually of benefit to spend less time in class but of course we cannot we cannot say we will replace all classroom training because we we do understand the value in in also having face-to-face trainings so I will hand over to cricket so that you can also share his experience okay thank you Tao see-through for after Fidelity Bank we have had an implemented eLearning over the last five years going into six and for us it was almost the same readings White House Key has eliminated urine hair presentation so before I proceed we just walk you through who we are and then we can pick it up from the reasons why we embarked on this journey as well so so Fidelity Bank is an indigenous ghanian bank that started off in 1998 as a discount house and has grown into a full-fledged financial institution providing all kinds of range of services with currently spread across the ten regions of Ghana with 72 branches currently and this started as the fastest growing banking gap and at the moment for us we believe that we want to build a world-class financial institution that provides superior returns for shareholders or stakeholders we who are identified as our customers our shareholders our employees and our regulators we were on to as part of our mission is to be among the top three banks in Ghana by December 2018 based on setting key performance indicators which includes the opposite equality of low-cost income ratio and retain on we tend to shareholders or stakeholders uncaught on our people our service and processes in our technology so for we believe that learning is moving at a very fast pace and there is a need for change in our approach to learning hanky learning and the reason is our code on all the time to compare to competence which is affected by the speed of change so by the time you make any changes happen things have just wrapped up and then you need to keep up - with the technology that is ongoing advances in technology is also a reason why information overload and then doing more with less resources available and obviously what many people will turn as the generational differences within the organization so we set out to build a learning culture as as the foundation of our janie so building a learning culture contains learning culture or strategy which we started and developed into a five stage approach so the first stage being supplemental the second place estate being targeting content to specific rules and then being strategic at the Ted stage and then at a four stage and Vistage is integration and optimization so we will look at learning and e-learning from the consumer perspective and here when we talk up called other consumer we are looking at the employees within the organisation from their perspective and are pained by the generational differences and how different ways with which people land so we use a description of going into an ice cream parlour and then having a full bouquet of ice cream and determining which one fits your need so we say at 86 percent of organizations globally are proactive in understanding how di employees lean the best so employees we also believe that our bar whelmed and disrupted most of the time and by different things happening around them and different things that they tend to learn and we think that 1% of a typical work week is order an employee ha to focus on training and development and this is emphasized in the basin and associate you market I report of 2016 so our whole learning strategy is anchored on the 70/20/10 principle which is the alignment to an impactful way in which people learn so we say that 70% of what people learn is to application yes yes to either connect by video we believe that I think I'm gonna have to do it by ambulance just a minute [Music] all right so we believe that 70% of the way employees learn is through their day-to-day activities that they do on the job which we term as application 20% is to peer learning or interaction with the relationships in the office collies line managers and even outside and actually 10% that people learn through the former learning way so in building upon that we want to tune in to the Lana's voice and we think that there Delana is always acting that you should give him or give me the tools and support that I require to change and adapt my current work practices which is uncaught on change solving new and solving new problems or problems that arises it's also another area of the employee applying with them they learn through the workplace with these three within the informal way and when you talk about a formal way employees land we are looking at giving them easy ways to learn in relations to what they already know and then also giving me or giving them with an in with new knowledge and skills that they require for the job and in this area we are looking at HR practitioners or institutions tuning up to the way they are employees land the best so we've done this by blending our learning programs currently on e-learning we have 300 skills of e-learning content which we buy off-the-shelf for all our employees and we've also worked in partnership with a Harvard Business School on with the mo using the a model of the Harvard management of programs for a middle level leadership development program which we pick it up and then we blended it currently we have trained over 100 employees within our lab middle level managers everything that it's you know a useful exercise so um in terms of learning for us we looking at it from a different a different perspective and unpacking our blended learning experience and what you see on the screen is an example of the various targeting that we do for our employees in building an e-learning getting time one of the key things that needs to be undertaking is the convinced and imagining convocation that organizations needs to embark on and these are examples of the things that we used in building our keys and marketing and building up momentum among gosta to ensure that we get acceptance from the end this is also an example of a consolidated report of how far we've been able to reach our employees within a path within the past three years of our journey from zero to a high report which has been a very useful exercise and we share this across a number of organizations within our country gun so just a star see also enumerated the various challenges and opportunities that I had we have also experienced some challenges as well one major challenge is the buying of senior of middle level managers were the core forefront of engaging lower-level employees technical environments of the content that we bought was at some point not suitable and conflicting with some of our banking applications which affected the learning experience which we have managed to resolve enhancing and we we embarked on building what we call elearning champions and assigning people to drive elearning with India videos and everything that we thought that it was we could have done better in that area there is always the push and a pull factor of learning where at some point we have to be oisin people to Elaine but the journey was to get to the point where people begin to pull content to themselves without a child or learning and development functions driving that extensively bandwidth issues have always been an issue and it will always be an issue until new ways and new things have been found local content development is also an issue which we are looking forward to building our own content and uploading it on our platform they have the many successes for us and we've been able to do a good campaign and marketing and communication counseling courses were selected and aligned to learning parts of our businesses and business strategies ownership of learning models by each business units is what we is one strategy that we use where business units we determine what courses should be should be applied to the ad department or unit and people with India in it we also want to set up learning centers new learning centers where people can easily go in and learn without necessarily and just to cut away the problem and the argument that they won't have time to learn we also set up lending months with which people can be dedicated to us in learning month where throughout the month there will be talks and communication on e-learning and sharing ideas of ways with which we could improve our learning experiences and as well we integrated our e-learning structure or program with our IOT instructor-led training programs or face-to-face training program so for you to attain any ill and classroom training it comes with a complimentary Learning Program that must be completed before you come into the classroom and it's a way of blended learning and encouraging people to learn on their own we also held elearning clinics or learning clinics where we went to the various offices departments across the country to engage them and get their buy-in and also solicit feedback from them on how we could improve the experience and then finally we currently using the various learning aids and summaries of the content that we have on our platform for group discussions within our department where we meet more each department needs on a day to day basis or regular basis and then they reinforce eyes their learning gains that each person has claimed and then how they can apply the learning that have been gained in their job so in some way it's it's a good experience it's been a good journey but of obviously with some challenges but we think that it's been a worthwhile and we are looking forward to partnering gateway Academy on the next chapter of activities which we've already done with some of their courses and has been useful to us I will give way to having those happen in the next few months as we partner with them as well so I'll hand over to the screen as well just you but thank you very much quicker and Chelsea for doing a very elaborated presentations to show us your journeys and the strategy that institutions have taken in order to make elearning a success so in the next session I'm going to share with you any lessons that we have learned on launching our e-learning project so so far through the Alpha the demo and the beta stages we have had over 250 learners from 16 financial institutions that have gone through the Gateway Academy to test and validate the concepts that that we started with the hypothesis that we started with from the beginning of the project so so far we have worked with the institutions that you see on the on the slide above and we've been able to reach all over focused countries except Malawi but right now we are working with Malawi on our next phase and therefore we'll be able to reach even beyond our forecast country these are the training service providers that we are working with currently and in the next phase we also reaching to other training providers so we have accion we have our colleagues that c-cup developed content we have helix digital services and strata more Business School in Kenya so for this section I'm going to look at what are those things that an institution needs to consider when they want to implement an e-learning program three important factors that all institutions must take into consideration when wanting to implement an e-learning program are one learning culture too widespread organizational involvement and three access to eLearning when we talk about learning culture notice we are not saying a learning culture but learning culture so learning corresponds to the effort that an organization takes to make sure that all their staff members develop the skills the necessary attitudes and behaviors that will make them perform well at their job you an effective learning culture also in crew includes training but not just training but goes beyond into development of the staff members where managers are actively involved in making sure that their staff members learn this means that managers continually encourage staff to share information within their department and also within the entire organization learning corresponds to a commitment to professional development from all aspects in the organization so from our focus countries and from the financial service providers that we've worked with we carried out our analysis whereby we compared the bank sizes of the different institutions in comparison with their learning sophistication and generally we were able to see that institutions that were bigger in size in terms of portfolio tended to have better lining sophistication but this was not always the case because we had smaller institutions like for instance FFP D on our own our grasp as showed that had also invested on that sophistic under learning sophistication systems in the organization the next point that you need to consider when an unofficial wants to implement an e-learning program it widespread organizational involvement and what this means is that there is commitment and support throughout the organization right from the CEO to the middle level managers and to the junior managers we have seen from our work with the institutions that we've worked with that success has been seen when the CEO and the HR directors are actively involved in the e-learning program as we've had from Quaker this means that institutions have to invest in strategies that encourage learning ecology learning and develop an e-learning culture that is beneficial to the organization's to be able to meet the needs of their clientele you we also noted that those of those managers that were involved in the e-learning programs that their staff took on these phases of all of the study those managed those staff members tended to finish the programs on time tended to be more involved in the activities in the teamwork activities that were required for some of the courses that they took external cost specific facilitators were able to do this but not as well as managers and supervisors of the staff members who took our courses the last point that we look at that you have to consider when you want to implement an e-learning program is access to a learning and access to eLearning in this point means that three things have to be in place one there has to be time allocated for learning the staff members have to have a device and this could be a laptop could be a desktop could be an iPhone could be a phone or earphones and other devices that make eLearning possible and they have to be also an internet connection just as what who has said that internet connection tended to be an issue and they are looking into ways in which they can make that easier for the staff members and it has been our experience that not one institution had all of them at the same time so from this slide you can see that the main factors that came across in terms of difficulties in taking our courses was the internet connection was not adequate some staff members said that they had to share co
puters and therefore they did not have consistent access to proper equipment and also they found it they didn't have a sufficient time at work dedicated to the learning you so I'm going to hand it over to Christine now and we will be able to answer your question in a little in a later time thank you hi Thank You Josephine and thank you quick ooh and tao-tsay um so yeah there were already some really great questions um you know just a few things that we did also want to point out it was really interesting the what we learned about access to different devices you know you could see from this chart up here that while 73% of our participants had access to laptops at home only 50% of them had access to Internet at home so Gateway Academy is addressing this by we created a mobile app to help people learn regardless of their device as you can see 87% of people had smartphones but people can also complete the learning offline and then once they're back with a Wi-Fi connection they can upload their responses and it can track their progress you so one of the things in regards to having having a place for learning we heard from Cousy that a B Zambia created their own their own lab and really by dedicating that space for learning they're showing their staff the high value that they place on it one of the other things to consider that we were surprised to find was that it's important to make sure that the staff has the requisite skills for eLearning right do they is is it going to be an easy transition for them one organization estimated that about half of their staff did not have the requisite skills for that another issue that we found was that internet connectivity you know this came up in the earlier presentations that it's a significant issue it's also a multi-dimensional issue right so many financial institutions will block access to external websites and so Gateway Academy needed to be cleared and any elearning platform if it's externally hosted needs to be cleared for viewing behind the corporate firewall and we all know how busy I to stuff are it at financial institutions they were many many hats so getting access to them and ensuring that the site was cleared was often a challenge it's terrible if a learners first experience is being blocked so that's where that earlier point about senior leadership buy-in is so important internet connectivity within the office can also be a significant problem so you could see in this chart that the most common response when we asked users about the regularity of Internet access and that was specifically asking about within the office nearly half of them said that it's sometimes difficult so another way that we are exploring solutions to this is creating low bandwidth versions or audio only versions of videos so they're not so heavy these are large SCORM packages elearning packages can sometimes to be very heavy so we're finding ways around that oops excuse me so we wanted to thank you very much for for taking the time to to listen to this in there were some great questions coming in through the chat I don't need to remind you how to questions with just in case I do there's that right hand box chat box on the right side of your screen and you can send in your questions and just please do select all participants to make sure that the moderator can see it I am going to address a few questions there were some general questions for Gateway Academy our colleagues were joining from the Paris office and there was a small issue there so I'm going to address the questions that were more general to Gateway Academy and then as soon as Josie and Craig ku and Josephine are back on let them take the rest of them one of the questions that we got was from somebody who wanted to ask about the range of e-learning that was offered on Gateway Academy and what we're talking about that's a great question so some of the courses that are offered through the Gateway Academy are you know text images sort of self-paced autonomous online courses that people can go through we also have some courses that are highly facilitated collaborative workshops where participants work together and small teams to complete different tasks so they're learning from the facilitator the facilitator gives them some framing information but then they're also learning from each other and we found that people were really interested in connecting to learners from other financial institutions and also across the region somebody else had asked a question you know right now Gateway Academy is if this question was from Rachel I'm sorry notice sorry about that right now gateway Academy is able to is working very closely with different financial service providers the vision forth and we are also working very closely with specific training service providers to build their capacity to offer eLearning however as this market grows you know Josephine's spoke about how we are facilitating a marketplace here as that grows the idea is that F ESPYs financial service providers can come on can select different courses training providers can make their courses available for a fee but that that takes time so right now that's a very highly facilitated a very highly facilitated process so of haiku and Cousy can are you able to unmute yourself and speak now hello Christy I think we have lost them they're not on the participant list could you maybe address the questions on your own I will do my very best so apologies and another thing that I will do is is get back to people who had who had questions so sorry about this so one of our other questions was Nathan asked some questions about making sure you know how do we ensure compliance and making sure that learners actually sign up and take this take these courses and compliance can be a big problem that is part of why that manager buy-in is so important one of the things that Gateway Academy is doing while early on we really focused on that learner experience in our next round you know we're about to release a whole new batch of courses for beta we have more facilitator tools so that those people who are involved get involved and encourage their learners that's why we feel like this needs to be it's an organizational effort and not just an individual learner effort and there were some other questions about that it looks like the Paris office is back on would you guys can you unmute yourself I see that you're back on can you hear that yes we can yay great thank you hooray we're so happy you're back so here is a question this is a question for both Tao Zi and quake ooh can you each speak about benefits that you are seeing at the institution level from eLearning and how are you how are you starting to measure that and think about that I'll meet myself thank you okay and from from this quick oh by the way I'm from our and the one of the benefit that we see is that there is obviously that acceptance of a continuous learning culture where you don't need to travel from the north of Kabul from our other provinces or regions to attend a training locally you can pick contents on our learning platform and then study on your own at your own pace so that's one benefit that we have that there's a vast array of learning content on different topics and different subjects available to staff to access and the other thing is that it cost-wise has been useful anything beneficial there's been some huge reduction in our enough in our course but that amount of reduction is then converted into other means of developing our employees by talent management and other aspect of it so the opportunity to have that choice to make to choose what we learn at what time and the freedom is one useful benefit that we have seen within organization mm okay Paul for us the major benefit that is the thing that we are going back we already have about 400 staff and very soon we'll have more than that even 1
 mr is the narrative in africa has been you sit on the news right now and i bet you it's something bad about africa you know right and um they are like these uh small glimmers where people come up and say hey that guy's invented an app this guy's done this right and i think we're contributing to that conversation so what it means for us as directors and what it means for me is an opportunity to contribute to that conversation and not only that to take it further because the way i view it is that this is just a platform but there is no reason why an african studio or an african individual cannot rise above disney cannot become bigger than them i don't see any reason why when you start showing people themselves on screen right they can fall in love they can get angry they can they can they can advocate for change they can be the hero they can go to space you start getting a new breed and crop of kids who start saying yeah why not why can't i go to space too you know because i saw the other guy going to space because everything is of course we lacked money you know and um it was quite difficult but like i have a mindset which is that um you have to start from somewhere you know and um as long as i can prove i can make 1000 shillings or one dollar it just means that i have to just i i can scale that you know and that's just my perspective you know congratulations sit down one of you did not hand in your homework and these books don't have any names on them huh who was it so caliban they ate my homework has been our flagship studio project and after doing a color band-aid my homework we learned a lot of things about production and the limitations of production in africa so we have been embarking on a journey since then to develop pipelines um how do we expand how do we get out there how do we how what mistakes did we make how do we train more artists and that's what we've been doing for these past few years and in the process that's how i get to also like these other international projects because they give me so much more exposure as to what we could be doing better over here you
hello rodias here we are going to be looking at setting up your zoom account so that your meetings run well your classes run well if you are scheduling for staff members staff meetings or scheduling for students classes there are some settings that you are supposed to do make sure that your meetings go on well now we already looked at opening a zoom account zoom has a website this website here zone so when you visit this website you should be able to sign up there is a button a year for sign up now the procedure is all documented here and we are going to be sending you this document showing you when you click on that sign up button what will you see you'll see an email a place where you type in your email zoom after that will send you an email and you can be able to activate your your zoom account by clicking on the link and the button which will be in that email that they will send you then from there you will be able to sign in and also the process is similar on a phone on the phone uh the difference is that you have to use an app you don't use a browser use an app and when you go there if you're using an iphone you go to the uh to the app store you search for zoom you'll see an app called zoom cloud meetings that's the one you use you don't use the other of others there that's called zoom things this one's only focus on zoom cloud meetings and so when you install even on android you install this app you also click on sign up in that case they will ask you for your date of birth your email your name you put in those details and after that they'll still send you an activation email so you click on that button which will go into your email you have to check your email uh as you're signing up for zoom and then from there when you tap on it you will be able to log in here it will ask you for some account information and then you will be able to share you the meeting yesterday you were given that assignment to do that and send you a meeting and send some screenshots that was the assignment for yesterday now today after you have created your account you can sign in i'm going to be showing you some settings here so let me click on sign in here when i sign in now because i already have an account that i that i created i can't use any let me use this i have a managing number of summer accounts for charges and other organizations and also i have my own let me log into this one here for the church here so when you log into your your account if you have meetings that you have shared before they will be appearing down there the main thing i want to show you here is the settings the settings which settings which are which ones are the best settings that we have to set to make sure that our meetings move on well the settings are in many categories we have security we have schedule meeting settings in basic settings in meeting advanced email notification and others all of them are on this page so when you click on any of these sections you should be able to see the settings that you need now the first up here is about to uh security there are security options we have what you call a waiting room and then a passcode you must have at least one so what i recommend is that you use the passcode now the waiting room is troublesome sometimes where if you have a waiting room and you try to admit participants some participants get stuck in the waiting room so it's better you leave the waiting room off but you put on a passcode the passcode should be on so that one make sure that you use that i'm going to just be uh talking about the key key settings that we were talking about yesterday the video you turn them off by default the participants can turn them later when they are ready to be seen some participants usually have their videos on when they don't you know the part of computer audio should be selected here it is the one which is going to represent the phone audio and the computer video don't use uh this telephone and computer audio let it happen okay be there by default there is this part of allow participants to join before a host now this part here it depends on the kind of meeting you are setting if you are setting a meeting for like staff members emit a link which you are going to be using as staff members to have staff meetings maybe daily or weekly you can turn this one on because the staff members are known you are going to send this passcode to only them and there's another person who you don't know who will join this meeting now normally for example you are the head teacher of this school and you are the one with scheduling the meeting you should allow participants to join they can join before you if you don't allow them it means that they will be stuck waiting for you to come and start the meeting every time uh so if the meeting is at four maybe you have a delay they will be there and they'll be waiting and maybe you you you are not able to give them the logistic yeah but if you allow them to join they can join and they can start the discussion the deputy is there and other teachers anytime you join them uh the meeting and that link can always be open the staff members at any time they can use it even for departmental meetings they can use it without you necessarily being there to start meetings that link you can be on 24 7 when it is always there and people can join and use it that is if the people that are using this link uh known and you trust that they will be using the link well yeah so that is the what you can do and uh there is something known as um a claim host claim host in case you fail to join this meeting the deputy or any other person or the dos can should be able to claim the host uh to take on the hosting rights so that he can be able to control the meeting community participants and make sure that the meeting is ordinary there is something known as claim host and it is only used when you have turned on the meeting so you go on your profile up here you click on your profile picture and you click on you are on your name so when you click on your name it will take you to a place known as the profile page now the profile page there you are going to see uh a feature known as host key this host is supposed to be a separate i'm going to display it here but i'm going to edit and change it later so that you don't see yeah so if i if this host key is a six digit number this host key you can give it for example let me put 35 as my host key okay it is refusing this kind of because of a simple format so it doesn't want to use the same performance so let me say 300 300. okay so this is my host key for now i'm going to change it later so this was sticky i can give it to my deputy so in case my deputy comes on to this meeting and i'm not yet there and the meeting is starting the deputy can claim to be the host using the host key you will go under the participants list there is a participants list at the bottom of their names there is somewhere where they will claim host that is in case these people joined with the future for joining meeting before host was enabled people are already on you are nowhere to be seen the deputy you empowered him with the hostiki so he can be able to claim host and say the same thing even in classes uh if the link has been set up the learners are on the teacher is on the teacher can claim a host and then he controls the meeting so he has to just click on that he claim host button and then from there he puts in that host key here once he say claim host he types in that and clicks okay he will become automatically the host and he will be able to control the meeting so that is one thing that you should know so if you have to set up that kind of meeting you turn on other participants to join before you uh you can put a time frame but you can leave this if that is in the case the meeting link is going to remain on forever that is if you set it as a recurring link without to giving it a time frame okay so uh that is a very important feature that i wanted you to know uh mute all participants when they are joining a meeting some participants join when they're in taxis in the places which are noisy you turn on these are the default settings then there's something about chat this chat if you are setting up a link for class meetings sometimes um if you know your learners and they are not stubborn elements it's fine everyone can chat and their messages will go everywhere but if you are cooperating an environment where they are the audience you don't know and so you can make it in such a way that if someone who sends a message it only goes to the host and the costs their demands are the ones because the learner is asking for something uh it should not distract others we have seen like in some of the trainings we have had public trainings there are some elements that come and this ascending other funny messages which is organized so if the messages are going everywhere it can be a bad thing but if it is only going to the hostile co-hosts then uh it should do it it is going to be that only the teachers will see and they respond to whatever the learners are asking without interrupting or distracting the others okay so that is the uh the feature there that you can be able to look at uh there are other things like sending files via chat this part of co-hosts you should always turn it on it should only stand on that part of costs you turn it on so that another a host can give other people to be cautious because the person may be presenting and he needs other people to support him in controlling the meeting so you can turn on the polls and quizzes which can be used at the end you can also turn on some of these features they can be used uh during by the teacher to get feedback from the audience uh then it is this shows them windows during screen share if you want to teach people about zoom and you want them to see the zone controllers as they are controlling then you can turn them on but if you by default we turn them off because when we are sharing we don't want memory to share this with the zoom screen we only want to show the presentation now who can share do you want uh you want to participate in the class where even learners will be sharing only but the challenge with this is that some learners are stubborn he can share his phone when there is some photo of ronaldo or some other person so to distract the class so you can limit the sharing to only the host and so that he uh the learners are not distracted the issue of annotations is also very important annotations are those extra marks uh that he are put on the screen uh when the teacher is teaching he can draw a flower i can when it's illustrating this presentation now zoom allows even the learners to annotate for example you can ask you can go to a screen and you want them to point on things and then they annotate but some learners they start annotating when the teacher has not asked them and they distract so uh here there is an option of annotation you turn it on but then you only allow the user who is sharing to another that is the teacher you only allow the person who is sharing to annotate uh other people it can be turned on during the meeting but by default turn that on so that the teacher does not have any problem then the whiteboard um you can allow uh save the whiteboard content as a picture because the teacher normally has some working there on the whiteboard so after that when it goes away it can be saved as a teacher then the meeting reactions do you want emojis you can limit them to just a few instead of having a lot of emojis there or you can leave them on it depends on normally they their kids no matter what you use those allow remove the participants to rejoin after i remove the student with stubborn uh a student will still rejoin and disorganize you so uh it is normally off by default unless if you want it you can allow the participants to rename themselves hide participant profile pictures in the meeting this one here you turn it on now many of us when we are signing up for our zoom accounts we just use the pictures which were now google they are not normally sometimes pictures it can be turned on later but by default turn it off um turn off that so that we just see the participant names the pictures most of the people don't have the right profile pictures there you turn on the breakout rooms uh so that um you allow the host plus and participants to the breakout rooms when it's scheduling like we're trying out yesterday you turn on all the options determine the breakout rooms if you don't enable these features you will not be able to see them the other side in your zoom app so you should be able to enable these features so that you can be able to to to to to see them the other side yeah so there is they also join from browser link you can show this in case someone fails to install zoom on his computer you enable live streaming you enable live streaming facebook youtube you can enable this live stream so that these options are available the other side in case you want to um to whatever then select this option you to request permission running mute yeah this one you can turn it on if you want the lens request permission unmute um if they want to speak yeah so you can but you can you as that mean you can always ask them to animate yeah so when the cloud information is available you send a copy to the person who showed you the meeting in this case the head teacher and also send it to the debut day because sometimes the teacher is not the one who has uh chaired that meeting so let the recording also be available to the reputative meeting in that case yeah so you can be able to um to have all these options the number of options here are now we are on notification um when someone is doing the meeting uh you get you get a notification um whenever you're going from trash so you can be able to have some of those notifications uh sent to you then there is this part of scheduling privilege you should do a sign a scheduling privilege uh you can assign the scheduling previously to your deputy such that he can send you a meeting under the school account uh even without you logging in so here you come here and click assign checklist privilege and then you put in so for example here i'm going to put in my email so i can put in my email like this and then i say assign so if i do that but it allows here it is refusing it allows the person whom you put as a scheduling should be also having a paid account and should be attached to this particular hosting account so uh if you have set up several we have um the zoom has what hosts you have set up you should be able to assign it is going to assign an alternative uh person so it is good to do it but it only allows the the other person is email also to be a paid account and when they are all within the same when they are connected here so that is the uh those are some of the main main settings that i really wanted you to know to do so that you can have a very good zoom meeting and uh you have when you have those things uh here now when you come to your meetings and you start animating uh for example if i start this meeting here the meetings will be listed and when you click on the meeting to start the meeting now this is in the zoom app on the desktop or even on the zoom app on the phone uh when you start these meetings as a host you'll be able to see all those controls and all those things that you have been enabling the other side you'll be able to see them here if you don't uh turn them on then uh this part will join with the computer audio automatically generally come down to when joining a meeting so that it doesn't keep disturbing you every time uh so you will have all your controls here uh the the options for security you can always the other side they will set default but you can always uh enable them rating room even if you turn it off the other side by default you can enable it at any time but by default you set it up when it is not there the participants list you should be able to see the options here if i was not to host the optional claim host is normally at the bottom here if i if i'm not in the party i'm already a host so the option for claim was you to see it at the bottom there uh the the issues of chat uh if you want the the learners to only chat with only the the the costs you can still change it from here even if you had made the default settings on the other side so by default it will be here but you can always switch if you want all learners to see their responses and all these options here the other side we have made the default settings but we can always modify those settings here uh to do the participants so you should know uh they should know how to the reactions are here raising your hand if you want to speak you press there and then and then your your hand will be there so that they they but the moderator can pick you the breakout rooms you break out rooms uh you should be able to know how to create breakout rooms if you want to break breakout rooms uh you come here down and then you say if there may be how many breakout people you say assign automatically and then you say create a breakout room so in that case it is when you say open all rooms it is going to open it is going to open all the rooms and then you will be in in the room but here i'm only one after that you can close the rooms you can send a message to all the people that you have one minute left and then you send the message all of them will be able to get that message then after that you can close the meetings and then they will be able to come back so in this case i was only one but this is where you go to the breakout rooms if you want to record to you live on youtube you just click on this part and then it will prompt you to stream your meeting to the youtube account that you have for the school and if you you want to record you should also be able to record on this computer recording in progress and your recording will start so you should be able to manage the zoom session manage the participants meet participants if you don't want them to to to speak and animate them and uh you can rename them if you want to put a profile picture which is better you can always edit the profile picture so that they you you change the picture so that people can be able to see a better picture of you okay so those are the recap of what we have covered uh uh on zoom and so i decided to create this tutorial uh to summarize each and everything that we have covered we are going to be sending you also the documents the documentation those of you who want to read and you can be able to keep practicing and be ready to conduct and host your zoo meetings uh accordingly so check out the go classroom we are putting all these materials on the google classroom so that you can be able to utilize them as you need okay thank you very much that is radius from the executive association
still struggling with uh okay all right welcome everyone yet back again to this session this session is going to be more interactive so i'm going to request most of you if possible all of you to enable your video just like i did with mine so that you can be sorry so that you can we can take your screens because we are going to be taking more of testimonials from this session we want to get feedback from you what you found interesting what you found very difficult and how you found the session dennis i hand over to you sir okay thank you so much moses and the team unfortunately i'm in a little bit of a dark room it has been raining this side so we are all inside and power is gone so um thank you so much first of all i want to thank the tao team for the incredible work they have done with the teachers with these teachers training they have persisted they did research they made sure that you have the content that you need to get started and we are internally grateful to it our team for that and we want to also say thank you to the teachers who sacrificed their time and their money to buy data to attend this training to the end so we have come to the end of this first group of trained this uh this first phase so you are the pioneer in this training and we are so happy that uh you are going to go out there and be able to showcase your talents your skills that you got from here and be able to be able to impact more learners out there so i want to take us through a session what have you learned from the training and i want us to be honest if you haven't learned much we still have other opportunities to learn because we have other trainings that are coming so don't don't feel shy to say i haven't learned this i haven't learned this i haven't learned that because we are here to help you uh get the knowledge we are not here to ashame you we are not here to to say ah that one doesn't concentrate we are here to help you so if you haven't understood something be honest and speak about it if you have understood something and you know you can't help you never know next time rogers and his team may say oh um paul can you come and be our facilitator because you seem to have understood this topic very well this is how you get recognized if you speak up and then you show people that you really understood and you can be able to help others who have not understood so thank you i'm going to start with william i'll actually  add me to your microphone and tell us your take away from this me from this training thank you thank you so much brother guys i'm so grateful i would like to first say good evening all of you good evening sir i'm william i like you from this origin i might say that i'm so grateful to edify uganda you have really i asked the word

as i talk i've been able to create my google class i've been able to send emails and do a number of things i have a google drive so at least i've got to know how to use all those things goku document and as a evening as i talk now i've designed a a google document from my school about senior and admission and i'm beginning to saturate it through this training i didn't know it but now i remember i presented it yesterday to my teacher and i was very excited about it wow all courtesy of 85 uganda so i'm really very grateful and secondly i used to not know much about youtube i usually would even be afraid to to subscribe but through the lessons i got to know more details about youtube and i am very bold right one of the things i put in plan is to have a youtube channel for the school and we're broadcasting different things that we have at school sometimes we used to have talent show we have music some trying to build up that and it's all courtesy of 85. there are a number of things though one thing that i've possibly not yet got well is he i've not yet got well the zoom part of it i that day i was i came late but i'm trying to follow up from a video i yesterday i tried to follow

you yeah network was disturbing me so much but at least i would pick i would do follow sometimes i didn't even do some of the assignments because i would have picked pieces but later on i would go into all the recordings and really i get it i'm very sure if we continue reading through we shall really get it completely and i'm happy that now i've been made a great i.t man though i wasn't an i.t person at all but i'm so happy and i request really if there is a way of continuing with such trainings i'll be one most happy man to be present all the time you are training because i'm a different

saying yes yes it is the river uh temp attended ever and i have learnt a lot actually beginning with the zoom and the google core operations and one of the most things i found interesting is about to this population whereby my staff members wanted to register our names to the district and they fortunately i i hated the issue and then submitted an online form and they started feeding and they could gather the information within a shortcut without putting without putting in a lot of effort so they said really it is really great and they gave me thanks and i saved these cutters of edify and again i've been able to do something related to google class i have my students i'm already in my class so the google class really i found it very interactive students are trying though some i'm facing with challenges some have not yet understood because i tried to create a zoom session but some other a few of them took the data about the google class and they are submitting shoes and they always opening the cloud thanks so much that is some of the issues and the again the quality i think i have already and i think i will improve it at some time and they right now  your trainings really say that you continue bringing up more trainings that will be able to assist us get out of this stack of coverage when we are able to do everything in a comfort forums thank you thank you thank you so much uh we were so happy to have you we were excited to have you on the on the training and we hope that you go and implement like you said you can be able to sit at the comfort of your house or your home and reach out to as many learners as you can thank you cut to kahira sorry if i mentioned the name badly place your app all right thank you very much as you can see right now i am standing at the foot of monterey i hope you can sit in the background yes we can see so i bring you greetings yeah i bring the greetings from fort potter the tourism city so i'm really so grateful for having been part of this uh training and i'm really saying edify thank you very much for having taken time really take us through the two weeks i know the tweaks have been so intense on my side i could sometimes go to bed past midnight because i wanted to try more as some of our lecturers or teachers were telling us and the truth is these two weeks have changed my entire ict life if i have to say that uh and i hope in the near future i'll have to acquire a laptop so that i can also have polibri the only unfortunate to me is that it cannot be on my phone uh i enjoyed the sessions i enjoyed the zoom i enjoyed the calibri now at least i have the studio i've already started creating content on youtube uh because i already have a youtube channel and then the most interesting bit which is really changing my life is i'm already now engaging my learners on the knowledge i've gained from this training because previously i could really have this introduction on whatsapp but it was not really coming out well but as i talk right now i have a google classroom where i'm engaging my learners currently and i'm really saying this one is going to take me to another level and if there are any other opportunities and if i can avail us i'm ready to have to be part of that and maybe i hope at one time i'll also be enrolled to be part of the edifier group uh the christian association and also change the lives of these ugandans and the world thank you very much for having us on this training thank you you are ready you're already changing if if you've already started reaching out to the learners you're already changing the lives we will just come and complement thank you so much we are so so excited to hear this feedback and we know that at least we did not work in vain the fruits of our work is beginning to show even now ah kasozi kazuzi you had raised your hand but you disappeared yes francie am i available yes you are available oh i'm sorry that the phone had a bit sucked down but i hope i'm now visible and not be hard yes  it's basically that i was not properly stationed at the start of the training i was a bit far and you could not really access everything but i was able to be in the class and i'm going to submit some an assignment on calibre though i was using a mobile phone and i could not install the software so but i would suggest and if we have another training if it is not if it is possible it did not be compacted so so that the sun like us can be able to catch up thank you so much for everything we shall all be very grateful and we hope that remains accessing the videos which i record on youtube thank you yes thank you thank you so much and by the way just for your information collaborate learning equality are working on a mobile app version of collaborate so with time right now it is in a testing phase some few people have it on their mobile phones they are testing it and then after the testing they will roll it out to the google play store so that you can be able to download and actually access install it on your device and have it on the go so we are excited about that announcement and we are eagerly waiting for it for now we can use the desktop version which is a free you can download online okay mathias mathews your turn oh thank you ah this is jenny mathias from bali city are you getting me yes we can't get you you're getting yeah you are clear

trainings uh held out to other teachers so that we can have digital platforms in our country thank you thank you so much thank you matthias thank you we are so happy that you were part of the program

classroom i don't know if that opportunity is there much smaller thank you we are we are having another we are starting another group of train training another group of teachers in the coming week so probably just join you can wait and join that group so you can start understanding that yeah so that you get right thank you thank you so much thank you very much thank you thank you that's my what was my concern all right you will be able to  paul are you there yes good good evening everyone evening sir  thank you for the training it has been unengaging activity for two weeks i'm a teacher of chemistry i also teach i have some somewhere where i teach online but the course has added value to me in almost all aspects yes it has been requiring a lot if you are to do all the assignments it required a lot but i will not be the same again i thank 85 for bringing it on board and i'm also happy to see that we we are different teachers from all over uganda this adds value because we have got the same skills and this is in line with education people already have always complained that people in kampala get better things than people in the rural areas but edify i think this is a step forward in making education easy to access for all yes i agree there are challenges especially of access to the internet but as teachers we have at least got something from the sessions we have attended um lastly let me tell you that me i stay in kampala and i teach in new upper prison there is a secondary school for inmates and uh i've just joined that place but uh i'll be a better teacher where i can sometimes not be able to reach i can do a lot of online teaching moreover with now the 85 skills uh i'm also making a channel a youtube channel and that will also be good for me and the rest of you people in uganda especially students i know i'm a very good teacher of chemistry but i've been lacking a way of reaching out to the students i thank 85 for all the value it has added to me thank you very much thank you thank you so much so much paul just an addition i want to commend a few people one of them is paul lubolwa there is peace and then some other people that have burdened to make sure they're online throughout the sessions and every time we went to the breakout sessions these people have been contributing really a round of applause to you paul and the rest please thank you thank you thank you and these skills that you've learned push them forward maybe some other time we'll have to look for people like you paul thank you i appreciate it yes thank you thank you paul uh by the way for your information our country director is on and uh is getting all this feedback in real time he will talk to us maybe after the feedback which we are ending in a few minutes uh more

training i didn't attend the first day i started from the from day two but i actually regretted missing the first day because day two was it was a little stressing because i don't know maybe because i was new to everything but i am so grateful and so happy i've learned so much right now i'm able to create a google classroom invite uh invite students to the classroom my colleagues it has been a very very wonderful training i am so grateful as i was able to explore a lot i was able to explore a lot during the the youtube channel creating a youtube channel creating a banner i really found uh some hard times there but then actually also realized and noticed something i was able to also create a video banner i don't know if i don't know if anyone has yet tried that but i tried it it was it's it's it's amazing it's nice to explore a lot at are you still getting me yes we are getting okay so um i'm really i'm really grateful i'm really grateful right now because of this training i'm going

there and they're doing and booms the practical bit of it it was it has been a very exciting experience i have tried to do all my assignments i've been having people that i'm talking to and and disturbing to keep doing the assignments with me and if some of them are not part of the training it has been really really really so exciting and i would love to continue doing the training right now

to talk much just want to say thank you thank you for each and everything you have done especially us who are teachers we have been there without knowing what to do depending some of us have been depending on choke and talk as a method of delivering content to the learners but right now we have moved a step ahead we have now gone vario and we are more of digital thank you very much for whatever thing you have done that is what i can say well thank you paul for attending and for making sure that you complete all the assignments and be there all the time the training is there we we are great yes okay thank you so much i'm very very very excited for the training so far it has been a very wonderful time of exploring a lot of discoveries and am very very grateful for the training because it i i discovered it was something that would start you up to discover even more that even even more that the teachers have not told you as you go along maybe to work on the homework the assignment you discount you go on discovering a lot of things so i'm very excited more especially that i used to look at youtube and i thought it was made for a special class of people that i can also go ahead and um yeah i didn't know that i can go ahead and also create my youtube channel and put their materials that other people can benefit from so i looked at it as i've not just created it for creating sex because of class it is going to remain and i'm also going to use it to bless and benefit other people more especially in the education sector and even other areas so i'm very grateful thank you so much for the time you are putting we are very grateful and i believe uh as we keep on it will will be better teachers and will benefit more people even in this time as we continue to get the training thank you so much god bless thank you thank you rose thank you for attending and giving us your time and resources to make sure that you have attended this we are happy to hear that you can be able to reach out to as many learners as possible and we are encouraging you to go on and explore more now teachers one thing i want to tell you about technology is that you have to be inquisitive you have to be curious you have to always click whatever you've seen clickable click so that you learn we learn by mistakes sometimes you will make mistakes but in technology we learn through the mistakes if you if you read about people who write softwares people will write uh these apps the collaborate programs that we are working on the google tools they have made millions of mistakes but they never got discouraged they were able to learn from that mistake and build even a better robust system so thank you so much uh for the wonderful feedback we are excited to have been uh the organizers of this program we are excited and we are happy to to all of where we are we are grateful to all of you for for really giving us your time and making sure that you have attended thank you so much um hand over to moses to one more thing yes before we before we invite the edify country director i would want us to all enable our videos briefly so we can take some group screenshots for posting in our groups it's only going to last a minute so let's not take long okay let's go let's let's open our videos please let's open our videos it's just going to be a brief photo okay okay um we managed yes i'm taking them here let's smile  okay thank you so much over to you moses all right it was really nice hearing from all of you and okay maybe that's what we get yes please yeah just a minute maybe before uh just a minute yes uh i i i want to thank all the members who have attended and uh all the people are coming through i want to encourage the members that  we are working on the certificates we are going to be giving them out we are still we are working on them we are going to be marking the we are still uh taking through the people who are really deserving to get the certificates in our google classroom and also in the attendance reforms yeah but uh if you have someone you have not yet finished yes the platforms are still open you can still try to do some work uh we shall continue uh sharing and supporting so this google classroom we can continue sharing from there and uh we shall be creating other google classrooms for other trainings yeah so uh you just if you have not completed some assignments for the example i've never completed summer assignments you go ahead and work on the work but the main thing is not just learning uh today i i go to i go to i go to uh someone calling me the healthy child i know i forgot in the school and was telling me that after today's after this session they are considering and they are going to be starting yeah so i want to encourage the schools that please you can do something you can start small if you can't start with the all the classes you can start with some classes and then you scale up yeah so you can start with the uh some particular classes and they'll say they need that you scale up let us try to apply this knowledge and then we shall be able to get more that's all i had uh thank you very much for this yeah so think now at this time i i want to invite mr good friend golovi to give us a one and then i shall be concluding yeah thank you thank you very much mr ukulele rojas and your team my name is godfrey it's been a pleasure to partner with uh with the christian school owners association and ital ict teachers association of uganda teachers they are teachers that are represented today i want to congratulate you upon finishing the two weeks of intensive training on ict learning techniques i know that each one of you has put in the best you can i miss the challenges of internet challenges of network challenges of the lockdown challenges of lack of adequate funding but i've been getting reports from dennis from utah on how diligently each one of you has been working to try and see that you complete the course and i want to say congratulations and i want to say thank you so much for i know that behind the hard work you've put in is that spirit to try and get yourself better so you can better serve the schools the communities where you come from i want to say thank you to itau for the diligent efforts that you have put in rojas and your team you have done incredibly amazing beyond our expectation to see that these lessons go on and all the involved details are aligned so we'll be extremely grateful for this relationship dennis my colleague thank you for all the tireless efforts that you put in to see that the classes can move on so dear learners who are teachers in this context as you can tell this has been a collaborative effort edify that i lead in this country that works in 11 countries elsewhere our mandate is to support lofty private christian schools and we support those schools with typically three key resources one being training or capacity building the other being i'm trying to see if i can share my screen correct one being training of those schools and we train the school proprietors we train the school proprietors so they can run their schools better that means their schools being compliant the government rules helping their schools to be registered and licensed hoping their schools to have good business practices helping their schools to have good leadership practices and helping their schools to keep records we also train these schools so that they can bring the gospel of our lord jesus christ unto the children by encouraging the children to read the word of god of christian literature and by encouraging the children to develop a christ-centered character and we train these schools so that they can have cash on learning outcomes by looking at the environment for learning environment for teachers and also emphasizing practices that can help children to pass the exam as well we also provide loan capital to the schools so the schools can be able to build more classrooms by school bus but more particularly during this scope 19 sorry about that that the schools do not get closed and continue open even during times like this and lastly we provide some education technology to the schools that need computers so they can have computers so they can have tablets whatever form of hardware technology that promotes learning and particularly this is where we have engaged with you during this lockdown that we can continue to help teachers like you that you reach out to the learners in the respective schools or communities where you come from we do this through partnerships like you've heard me share briefly we partner with ict teachers association of uganda we partner with christian school owners association and so many other partners to see that these objectives are realized friends they are teachers they are graduates for today i would love to encourage you to use the knowledge you've gotten today the time and money and effort we have spent will bear better fruit if we all do something better than we have learned this is the beauty with the technology the technology has no boundaries you could be i have had some people from port porto some people from cavalli people from gulu they have all been learning online without necessarily leaving their locations now we can multiply we can replicate this experience for our schools we can replicate this experience for our learners for our communities that even though the school doors are closed even though the school gates are closed but the minds of those children are not closed the minds of those teachers from the schools you come from are not closed that you can create an impact and you don't need to wait you don't need to wait friends one person can create an impact the children need you every child need is a hero and you could be that hero but instead of the children wasting their lives in villages that you could that get your time and the skills you have learned to try and help those children create google classrooms create zoom lines invite them send them out to parents this is the way we can create a repo effect with the lessons that we have learned today and if that happens friends think about it if that happens let everyone reach out five learners let everyone reach out to 10 learners it's a thousand of us those will be a hundred thousand children that could have an opportunity to learn and i pray that these lessons also become institutionalized that you can go back to your school and challenge your school owner challenge your health teacher and communicate to them that it's possible that even a time like this you can engage the learners so friends we are embarking on you as edify we are embarking on you as christian school owners such as that this training these online opportunities can be made a reality in our own schools and i believe it's possible because you have experienced it i've enjoyed listening to some of the testimonies of some of you saying look it was my first time using youtube i didn't know google classroom can work now we know it works and let's put these opportunities to work once again on behalf of edify and on my on behalf on behalf of vital christian school owners association and all our partners we are very grateful that you consider this an opportunity for you to dedicate your two weeks of time of resources to be part of this classroom thank you very much for joining us a

do you see anything of mine yeah yeah we can see your presentation even the live stream has worked so i think members you can disable the waiting room what  enter your slideshow okay it's okay okay all right so i'm accepting entries henry remember we only have an hour yeah i'm going to summarize and uh hello members hello henry we can hear you very well you can hear me very well okay are we still waiting for some members yeah i think the turn-up is still low so maybe we can wait for some three to five yeah some three to five minutes so as i can see we have around 39 participants at the moment let's give i also wanted to share this video to the group let us start immediately hello hello members yes henry we can hear you you can go ahead i go ahead yes please okay it's henry the computer guy and i'm actually going to be taking you people through the presentation how you can create a presentation and we are specifically going to be basing on our powerpoint we shall also talk about the google slates and also how to use the wps either on a mobile device or on your computer specifically so can you also see my my screen yes we can see it okay so specifically powerpoint is an application designed for presentation purposes uh as you're seeing me here you can as well be using it either using a projector or using it over the world over the internet so it's specifically for presentation purposes as i'm doing it right now uh and there are four the primary purpose for it is specifically to help you to create to design some of the presentation and even print some handouts for example if you wanted to so specifically another application that we can use as i've told you we can use the google slides and we are going to be seeing how we can actually use our google drive to access our our wps oh the what the bubble slides and uh what can we do specifically in uh what is a slight composite.org it can compose of any text that you have let's say you want to write something there you can include pictures there you can include graphics tables you can even add the sounds to your presentation and you can run them either automatically or when you have a control over it either by clicking onto each slide that you want to either to play yeah that is how we have uh specifically the interface so for powerpol for powerpoint and uh i will identify some of the parts we can actually be in need of and uh this is actually what we call the slade so it can be the page that actually you're going to be using to write your information there so aside here we have the office button we can be using this one to make some of the changes either to save to print or make some other changes like either opening the already created what powerpoint presentations that you have we also have the quick access toolbar up here which can as well help you to add some items to it such that you can always access it with hello moses i think we lost you henry yeah henry seems to have a good turn off now he's on i think he's just having network issues henry are you sorted now are you fine now is your network okay now could be his audio are you hearing me yes henry we can hear you now yeah we are now talking about how we can create our presentation specifically so you're going to be learning how to create our presentation you'll be able to do these things that i've actually done that i'm presenting here on your computer or on your phone specifically so what we do so what can we add to our slides for example we shall see how we can add a new slide and how we can duplicate some of the slides and how we can reuse the what that says for example you had already created a presentation and you want to use the slides into your presentation it can always be possible so we shall we shall be doing this for example i'm going to eat let me let's say let me change this thing as practical as an even uh let's say that the explanation how do you see can we do it from combined i think we can do it combined to save time combined because uh actually when i talk about something here i will actually have to illustrate how it works for example now if you i told you want to access powerpoint or presentation software you're actually going to be coming to your start button actually you're seeing it down here then uh you're going to come to your programs when you come to your programs you're going to look for uh microsoft powerpoint and this is android okay are we there remember as i see my my screen okay okay now we are going to do this thing practically so we shall afterwards give you the presentation so you can go through reading through a little then we are going to do this practically so now if we want to actually access our presentation we are going to click onto our our start button then we shall look for our programs onto our computer then we shall be looking for what we call microsoft office yes uh maybe you have shared you are sharing only one application share them very quickly yes yes yes please could you please share your best  person share this and then you re-share the entire desktop not just the powerpoint okay stop sharing this one first then you select the entire desktop okay you see it now no yeah we can see now you can't see now eh yes okay it's fine i was saying that uh if you wanted to access our your presentation software you're going to come and click onto your start button just down below here then you're looking for what we call the programs then you'll be selecting what we call the microsoft office you can't be having different versions for example you can have 2007 and let's say 2013. so we can use any that we fail we want and for this case we are going to try using the 2013. so you give it time and loads so when it comes as this to give you a blank and some of the templates which are already there so you're going to select the one which is blank and by default it will give you that as we are seeing it and remember we said that uh here we have what we call the office button and in this case this is called the file it has times changes depending on the version that you're using uh here we are using 13 but the other one is specifically 2007. so it changes to alpha a file are we there so now we have our first page as this one it is telling us to click to add something this is called a press holder it is going to be holding our content so i can write something there for example i can't say if i'm type something about let's say corruption so that is specifically the corruption so i can add something here for example if i already created some information i can just copy it and paste it there with an event after of time for example if i have some information i can copy it from my work then i'll say copy then i can minimize this one i come and i paste it here so that is what we are having for the first word for the first page and we say that up here we have what we call a ribbon this item that you're seeing that is having this insert design and others it is called what the ribbon are we together now if we are and if you actually wanted to do anything onto an item on your slide you first have to select it for example if i wanted to modify anything on my quad corruption i will have to select this item then i can come up here on some of the changes i can put for example i can come and change the size to anything something big i can come and change the color to anything that i feel i can even make it bold i can make it italic i can put it in the center to the right it depends on what exactly you want that is how we can insert a slide we come to new and put another new slide that we actually want to put there but it depends on exactly what you want to write if it is actually the title you can pick the title slide if it is titan content you can pick if it is uh let's say comparison it depends on exactly what you want so i would pick what we call the title and the content so i'll put my title here then i'll come and put my content here so specifically for this presentation we are going to use only three slides so let's come and get some information here we already have it let's see ways in which corruption is practiced we copy that one by right clicking and say copy then we come back to our presentation then we can paste that one there by saying ctrl v or clicking on paste you can put that one in this data we get some other answers there we can have these points copy ctrl c then you can come here and press ctrl ctrl v so we can get another new slide by coming to new then we pick either titan content and we are going to end with this slide we shall do all the modifications on only these three slides so you'll come and get some content let's say forces of corruption then you're going to come and paste them here ctrl v you can put that one in the center also then you can come back to your work you pick some other points then you can paste them wherever you feel you want ctrl ctrl v that is exactly how you can put content there or you can type it but with the event of time you are not going to be typing you know how to type you can just copy and paste now let's come and change our design we want to see how we can actually change our design of our presentation you will come to what we call the desire the design and they're going to provide with a lot of designs here you can select from you'll see whenever you hover over that design it changes the look of your your what your presentation and the times there are all the themes they actually give a look or a certain look to your presentation so we are going to select one of the designs here and we have selected that one so when you click on it it changes the entire look of your presentation that is how you can actually put the desire that design and now when we actually go to what we call uh when you go to what we call that what the the animation all that transition we have the animation and the transition what is the difference between the two the transition transition is specifically that's change that occurs as one slide changes to another so we can come to the slide here then pick any transition that you feel you want to use on your slide or presentation for example i want slide one to be taking let's say let's say the cutting if i'm opening let's say the presentation it will do like that they need to open my presentation just like in the beginning then i come to slide it to i choose a different it will act like that oh i can't use this it can do like that so you pick any type of uh let's say the transition that you feel you want to use then on the third slide we can also choose another one so what you have to note is that whenever you go to another slide you have to choose so if you don't want to be using you can say applied what applied all if you want them to take only one transition you can click on what we call to apply to all so having talked about the transition we can also talk about the animation so animation is just the the life you give to an object on your slide for example if we have a slide one we can highlight the title for example the heading let's say this is corruption i can't give it a let's say an animation which is uh it can be entranced it can be emphasis it can do anything that you feel like for example fly in so it will come just like that then i can select my definition i can also give it another one it's a float i'll go to another slide i'll select the transition sorry the animation after selecting the word let's say i can give it let's say a spin so it can rotate as i the way you see it on your screen there then i also click on these other points i can let's say choose another one that i feel i want zoom so you see them then on our last slide i can say the heading i click on the wave just like that and i can come to this one i can as well say another for example so that is how we can also apply the what the animal hour contains your education onto your slide you'll come to what we call the insert so when you come to the insert it will allow you to include images for example i come to all my pictures for example they can be on the desktop they can be in my documents or they can be somewhere on your local districts for example c4d but for that i already opened a folder that has some of the images here so it's the one that we are going to use we have some of the images we can select one image and put it on our our slide for example begin with slide one i can put this image let's say from slide through you put that image for letterman down i think we've lost henry again but i think he's going to be reconnecting shortly in the meantime as we wait for henry i think i can be taking in some questions hello yeah am i back all right sorry for the interruption henry am i back yeah yes yes you are people yeah i'm sorry the network is not fine so we have put our image here let's go back to slide one and also pick another image let's say we have this then we can select this one and hold down drag so we can put this one somewhere onto our slide one you can put it in any location then slide it too you can also use another image by checking from our own images that we have you can as well download these images over the internet for example you can come and download this we have to use google chrome it will open then you can use it actually to download some information that you want  so when you come to google you can come and type any type of images that you want for example you want to put corruption you can type corruption into google then you press enter when you press enter it will come yes please henry members are not seeing uh the google chrome they are not fair you need to show you need to share    excuse me are we there now what's this  are we there now yes please yes i think we need it yeah we are there now it's fine i request that uh we go a little bit slow not try to build time because at the end of the day we want the teachers to understand this not just be part of it yeah so even if it goes a little bit beyond time as long as people have understood what they are supposed to to learn that is what matters thank you dennis okay we're all seeing they're closing and then they begin yeah i'm closing it then i i do it again so now you can come uh to your what your browser for example i'm going to be using google chrome i will double click on it so if it opens you can look for google for example then come and type any topic that you feel you want to get pictures for if i want let's say for corruption i'll write corruption let's say i press enter then they'll give me some of the information related to corruption i'll come to the images now so when i come to the images they'll give me items related to corruption you see them there yeah then you can pick any image that you want to download from the internet for example i want to select this one i'll right click on it then i can say copy image or save the image as something onto your computer it will ask me where to save that image for example in the desktop i'll put it here i'll put it there for example i can name it as they say corruption corruption one then i can save it onto my day my desktop so i can now download it because it has shown us then you come to your desktop and look for that that image that you have already downloaded and it is now here it is displaying so if you open it it will display as this one so you can as well come to your desktop copy it right click then you can come and click on that the copy you come back to your presentation you come and paste it anywhere that you feel you want for example here i'll paste it there has everyone got how to download an item over the internet yeah yeah so that is it so whenever you have a presentation you're making you see you need an image that you want to include there you can as well use that internet it has everything that you feel you want to use in your presentation so that one was specifically that let's look at uh another item and that is specifically the slide what the slide show so after you finishing creating your presentation you want to display the presentation to the audience let's say in class using a projector you need to put that one all displayed as a slide one slide show it will cover the entire screen for the audience to see what you're presenting so we come now and look for our our slide show so you click on the slideshow then it will ask you how do you want to present the slideshow is it from the beginning of from uh let's say the current slide you're on i can say from the beginning and it will have to cover my entire screen for the audience to do what to see what i've already done so now we have actually we have not given it time but we can also give it time for example to do it automatically or on a certain let's say search time that we fail we want to use so you can if you i start clicking it will bring the items that have written there just like that so you present your information to the audience whenever you feel you are finished you can press an arrow it goes to the next other other slide so if you feel you are done with doing that one you can also do anything that you keep on going to another point like that like that like that so up to when you finish the entire present day so now having talked about that one we can set the timing for all our items there also for example how do you want it to last on the screen so you can set the duration from actually here either you want it to be automatic after some time or after when someone has clicked it so you can choose these two options for example i want it after one or two seconds it will be following that time that you have selected it onto it and now we want to see how we can also make a presentation using our mobile phones so now i have created a video onto that one i'm going to share it here such that you can see how you can use that one so we have a video here it is going to show you how you can create a presentation on your mobile phone let me play it i don't know whether the sound is fine it's fine we can hear you okay not filing it's not fine henry you might want to do it the way i just did yet okay you explain why the video is playing because the the audio okay let me put it back and i explain as it is playing so now when the video actually when you open your phone you will have to search for let's say google cloud play store to download what we call wps onto your your phone  your computer so it looks like in that format you see it so when you open it it will show you that item wps office are we there then it will also take you to that location where you can download it from but if at all if you're not having it but for me i had it already so i didn't install it on my phone because i already had it so now after you'll open it onto your home your phone it will be looking like that are we there then you'll open your wps it will look like in that format it will show you some of the documents you're actually having there then you'll come and click onto this plus symbol if i told you want to create a new one it will show you some already the documents that you already have there and you can even come and click on open and see some of the items we can do our document we can make our presentation from there we can do excel we can do pdfs we can make our text and others it can allow you to obtain information or access information on your device your sd card or memory card google drive from your recycle bin from some downloads your whatsapp telegram and even in my documents so it can allow you to go to any but for our case we are going to be using only the creating of the new one so you click on this plus symbol do you hear are you hearing me yes we can hear you yes even the video we can henry just continue explaining as the video plays because uh we can't hear the sound of the video because of i think you are in the the the audio input is different not the one from the computer let me just take us through the procedure i gave you the procedure let's go through all of them okay just keep explaining as the video plays people will keep following in line you're using already the microphone so the video cannot use the microphone can i share my screen on the phone yes henry you can share okay let me share the screen on the phone you allow me you hello i'm sharing my screen we can hear you sharing the screen now do you see my screen now are you seeing my friend yes now let's begin afraid i say that if you are using your phone you're going to come first of all and install an application called what wpa yes yes i'll search for our play store for example if i come here under the type play play store so when the play store comes just like that you're going to type that stop sharing your screen with the laptop okay and then you start sharing your screen with the comp with the phone okay okay i'll stop sharing it hello now do sharing with your phone okay yes we can hear you you can hear me now i'm sharing my my screen you do do we see the screen now we can't cheat let's do it afresh now yes by coming to what we call the play store so i'm going to look for my play store henry yes first mute first your mute your laptop mute your microphone okay don't forget to unmute the phone   hello henry unmute your phone you get me now yeah we can hear you clearly now and you can see everything yeah yeah now you're she's watching to show you my screen you're seeing it download wps from your what from your play store i'm going to look for my play store first of all i'll play play store so when i come to my play store i'll have to type there the wp s wps office and it will bring for you those applications that you see them then you can click on one of them that you're seeing there but for me i'm having it it will just tell me to update if you're not having it it will tell you to install install it are we together yeah okay so now i'm not going to do anything i'm just going to close i open it because i already installed it so let me look for it on my applications it is in the corner here so i'm going to click on it and it opens they already faded one let me close it and begin a new one because i made a video using it so let me just make a new one so when you open it by default it will take you to this and i'm already signed in as henry the computer guy so now what you're going to do you can first of all open some of those ones which are already there you can look for them onto your phone for the files which are already designed using let's say your computer you can associate them using your phone for example it can be a document word powerpoint excel pdf it can be a text and others you can search it from your device you can search it from your sd card for example memory card you can have it from a cloud let's say you store information over the internet you can even use your google drive if you store some information there you can also come down here to other items for example that downloads you can check there and see whether they are there i have some files which are there but for our case we are not going to look at this we want to create a new one are we together so what you do you click on this plus symbol that you think here okay so when you click on it it will ask you what you want to do i have one i have presentation i have spreadsheet i have a pdf but for our case we are going to use our presentation i'll select the presentation so by default it will open for you some of the templates which are already there and we also have one which is a blank so some of these templates are paid for and some are free a template it's like something you can let's say edit sorry it has some information that you can edit from and use it for you that you really want to use it for for example there are many here but i think many of them are supposed to be paid for but for our case we are going to be using a blank and this is how it will open for you it's like the way we have been using it on our computer it will tell you click to add but here it is telling you to double tap to add something let's say if i want to tap this i add let's say corruption so i'll double tap there it will write let's say corruption are we there should we type no don't type i'm just showing you do it as your practice then when i come on the second down here they will tell me to double tap and add items i can say let's say this refers to let's see the dishonest they say that this one is off proud fraudulent lesser conduct by those by those in power evolving in bravery that is it so if you're done typing there what you actually do click aside so it will accept the information i put there down here you think that they are telling us that we can add another another type let's say another slide you click on that class it will give you many of these slides here you can the layouts you can select from for example i want titan content i'll click on that title so i can come and say double tap and type something ways in which corruption is practiced within which option is practiced then i can take the answers double tap and set the bravery press enter go to the next line they say through extortion enter go to the next line let's say you can say through embezzlement or through nepotism let's end on those ones we click aside here we come to slide three you can add another slide there you choose the type of play that you want from the wide range of them here which are displayed for you i want titan content i can say causes of corruption double tap then i can come put some theory answers there let's say grid for money double tap enter you go to the next line you can select the low press freedom into go to the next line let's say you can't say economic freedom so now we are done with some of the options we can put that we are going to specifically use some three slides as we have them here so we want to see how we can make changes onto our phone using a presentation let's come back to slide one by clicking on it we have some tools down here we can as well put some uh items as you see it let's first of all put the design so we have some of the designs here i can change the color you think i have a lot of colors here i can pick from the one you go on clicking on it goes on changing the car but you have to make sure that uh yes i have not got to where i'm supposed to collect the signs they're designed so you see where your slide is down there i have slightly one slide two plate three there there's something down here that is showing uh the two we have the picture you have seen it it is the first one so click on it you there then you can come and select the the types of colors of the background colors you feel you want to use this we have used that one for that case we come back down we can select another slide click on it you can select the background also the assignment this one are blue then i can come back to slide three i can come and check change the background also by giving it that one so now you're seeing that all of them are having different uh colors so that is how we can put the actually the background of that what the presentation we can also decide to put a picture into our presentation by coming to the next thing which is saying picture you click on it it takes you to where you have your pictures in your phone let me take one picture from my phone i'll select this one then i'll click it yes i want to accept it then i'll put okay it comes to my presentation as that i can minimize or make or resize it to something very small which can fit on my slide you see then i can put it up in the corner then you can click aside that is how you can put a picture we go to slide two i'm going to put the same picture on all of them they say i selected this one i can say okay in the corner i click yeah then i can resize it to what i want then i can put it also aside i go to slide put the picture there by selecting from my phone it depends actually i had not downloaded them but i have only this one it can indicate corruption as people are eating people's money these are people actually they are not looking after people so that is how we can actually add the pictures there you can come back to the tools you can even add this what the inserter table you can insert a shape for example i want inside a circle you can put it there you can make it in any format that you feel you want so you can even command inserter let's say a what a table yeah we are there let's say we are told we wanted also to change some words here same some let's say the size of the title we can click on the size then scroll down you can say 96 it becomes somehow bigger i can also change another one let's say i can make it bold i can give it a color you think then i can select uh unless i want it in the middle i can say to the left let's say to the middle or to the right it depends on what you feel you can't even make it bold you can even make it italic you see those things items that i have here you can even change the font style for example you have one times new roman you want this there are many here you can select from a wide range of them so it will change according to what but some of them are supposed to be both you see they're telling me that lifetime i have to buy it so let me go back i'm not going to use that one you get so we can remove the that one we come to the second slide you can come to click on the heading again you can come back down to that tools you can give it a color i want blue blue cannot appear on blue we put black there or we can change to red it will be visible then you can also put onto this slide three we go we selected our title we come back to our tools we can select more colors we put a dark color there we can even change the size the way we said by increasing it to what you feel you want to you can even enlarge these text boxes where that heading appears but this one is too much bigger you can change it to that one then we can go back now i want us to put some of the transitions you can come to the transitions for example you come to slide one you come and say tools we look for transitions you just come on scrolling here down here where the arrow is yeah you can do the transitions when i come to my transitions i can apply transition to my slide for example i put that you see the change i can put that one i can put that so it goes on doing that you can go to let's say slide two if you also wanted to do it uh you can pick or you can pick one and apply to o to all for example i pick this one i can say apply to o to all and the effect goes to all these place that i've made in my presentation so now having put everything there for example what have you put you can even put a text box if you want it right in a different location that you want text box is down here you can click on it and it brings the text box so you can as well drag it and put it somewhere that where you want and even rotate it in a format that you feel you want by clicking on it then you can double tap and rotate so i can put let's say this is presented by me henry we are going to be doing more of the advanced features and procedures so let's see how we can yes you will display the activity that they are going to try out um let me show them how they can save it so up now where you see the word done you'll come and click on say on save it it will allow you to give it a name of your choice please i'm going to save it as as corruption then you can say save so it will save it onto your your phone so you can as well have it as a presentation so now let me switch back to to my computer and i show you the activity i'm going to stop the sharing here then i come to my sharing of the laptop so we come back to the activity the activities down in the presentation so that is the activity so in this activity you will use the internet through the link below and this is our link to create a simple first slide presentation about so do you hear me we are in this activity you will use the internet through the link below to create henry yes please first mute your phone i'm i was switching off the phone okay you hear me yes sir yes hello yes we can hear you hello henry just continue yes we're here hello hello we can hear you very well  henry i don't know whether you are not hearing us  the um that henry has displayed we can be able to read it here  we are going to to have this activity on google classroom it is a simple activity here for you to create slides you can use your phone or you can use a laptop whatever you are ha
ing to create a presentation now um maybe as we we went up with this spatula session henry thank you very much for sharing that and giving that introduction to the members now please yes very small yes henry uh it's okay i've i've explained the activity it's fine i've explained the activity you just post it on google classroom and uh we are going to be engaging with the teachers yeah so uh maybe something small here what we are going to be doing in the afternoon we are going to have uh some teachers uh who are going to be the teachers who are teaching these lessons on youtube we have lessons which are going on lessons by lessons for learners from nasa up to uh senior five and these teachers they create presentations every day now there are many things that you have to know when you are doing a presentation if you it depends on the class if you are doing a presentation for for a p1 class there are things you have to look at things like fonts things like colors things like shapes there are a number of things that you have to as a teacher that you have to consider when you are making a presentation and it is an application that you are going to be doing using on a daily basis on a daily basis when you are teaching online you are going to be using powerpoint so we are going to have some teachers for example if you look at this lesson here by mr or tim he's teaching here english but one word he comes at a time as he's teaching how does he do that how do you because with english you want the learners to to read uh to move along with you how do you use the fonts how do you use all those things so we are going to be get hearing experiences from some of those teachers and we also have some teachers who are teaching physics and mathematics how do you use some of those formulas in your presentation so that is one thing that we are going to be uh one thing that we are going to be uh looking at later on in the afternoon we are going to be sharing experiences with these teachers uh in using powerpoint and the various tools then also there's something i've noted as henry was presenting about zoom yesterday we said we looked at zoom yesterday but we didn't end there the the process is going to continue we are going to continue learning a few things so when henry was sharing a video and we're not hearing the sound there is an option at the bottom when you are sharing it's known as share computer sound you have to enable that when you are sharing so you when you are sharing in zoom you can either select a window or the desktop so the case is where henry was sharing and he was seeing the powerpoint and you're noticing the dystopia clicked on the application so when you're sharing if you want to share the entire like right now i'm sharing the entire desktop so the whole desktop is visible if i want to share with the sound i go ahead and i take this part and i also take this part where it is optimized for full screen video flip there the audience will be able to to hear your sound and uh the experiences we have had today are learning experiences and we are going to be facing the same as we as teachers when we are teaching their learners are seeing our presentation are we sharing our screen when we are making the presentation you have a phone how do you use your phone i have uh teachers like um if you go to the youtube channel uh teacher aria daniel has been using a phone uh if you go to the youtube channel lessons by teacher daniel you can check them out he uses a phone uh many times and is teaching physics so it is possible to use a phone and have a very good presentation delivered uh onto the screen i've been seeing some of his lessons when he's using a phone so teachers this training is for you and for us to share experiences and i want to encourage you that we come here not as experts of everything but we come here to share experiences together and we are here available for you so right now uh we are going to post the assignment uh in google classroom and also in the whatsapp groups try to create some slides and then let us come here more best practices on creating educational content using powerpoint i think that is uh what i can say uh to supplement and summarize today's session i'm seeing two hands uh let us have teacher christopher and the two hands which are up to give a comment and we wind up teacher christopher  yes am i on  thank you very much for the experience given to us and just pretty good that you continue with that i think spirit now i have only one question and that is that's how to use the wps now my question when when you send a document in there in in the wps can you be able to share it in case you are in a zoom classroom and you are able to share what you wrote today what you said in the wps and share it with the children you're teaching is it possible that's right that is what that is what teacher daniel does and he's going to be sharing with us how that is done you just click on share you go to you rotate your phone and the learners see it you can open your wps you open the work and they see that is possible and it's being done mr bosco bosco  and somas  you try to animate let me enable animating here everyone yes please i can't hear you yes uh may i don't have a question but uh i it's just a big thanks to the organizers of this program really we are benefiting a lot from this program and i do encourage all the members to keep time and always logging in time to share these experiences and i believe me as thomas i believe that with the time i will be able really to to to get whatever we are discussing right now so it's actually my purpose of raising their hand is to thank more so the facilitator for today really really got something out of this this presentation thank you very much okay finally let us hear from a lady kassarin catherine no i didn't i i wanted to make the same appreciation unless maybe you want me to pray sorry just okay you pray for that mr president i think we have to yes yes i've actually created a video on how to use wps on the desktop and on the phone and i've uploaded it so people can as well first review it if they want i've tried it and i've put it on youtube thank you all right yeah so members the tutorials uh mr henry has done them so you can if you have missed out some steps you can in your free time watch slowly by slowly he has created some some video which was playing early and you're not getting the sound uh he has been uploading so we are going to share it in the whatsapp group and also on google classroom as we put the assignment we shall put it also as a resource for reference yeah so uh the training of one hour members one thing that i want you to know is that in one hour one hour you're supposed to come here for everything on what you're supposed to do you don't expect that you learn powerpoint within one hour it is something that is taught in a school for three months so what you come here to get is to to get to know to get a debrief on what you're supposed to do you're supposed to invest time in yourself to do the practice and you learn more of the things as you practice and as you start yeah so what we have here is uh you come here and you pay attention to what is being demonstrated and then you go and try to attempt the assignment where you get a problem we are available to support you one-on-one on whatsapp and also you can be able to reach out in the bus as we move on so if you come and you are switched on your computer you want to be doing what henry is doing at the same time you will fail you just have to be attentive and follow what is being done then guess the reference material get the tutorials we are offering that get the support we are offering and attend to the assignments in google classroom now we are on the first day someone asked about certificates and i say we are not going to give certificates but uh later on when we were discussing the team we said we can give some certificate because you people are putting in your data and your time for two weeks so you get the skill we are going to design some certificates but they will be given to those who accomplish who will do their assignments because google classroom is going to show us uh is going to show us the uh the people who are submitting assignments so they are the ones who are going to qualify for the certificate so the certificates are going to be given and they are going to be uh they are going to be basing on on on what you are doing in in the google classroom so please when you you if you don't have the link to the google classroom i can send it again in the chat that is the meeting link you go to the google classroom and you attempt the tasks that we are putting there where you get any problem we are even available to zoom in with you only one-on-one even if it's at 10 pm we are ready to support you uh we always online just get and then we shall be able to support you to make sure that you are there so when you go to go classroom don't post the work in the stream i've been seeing sample posting work in the stream like you can see here uh mr nicolas mr nicolas rucundo he has done his assignment on zoom for yesterday but he has posted it in the stream here on google classroom this work is not going to be marked and i put there a comment that thank you for attempting the assignment please click on the class worker tab look for the sign the assignment and that's where you're supposed to serve me so when you have to submit your work you go to the part of classwork classwork on google classroom and then you look for the assignment so these are assignments there's an assignment of zoom on google tools there's an assignment coming for presentation it's also coming so you click on the assignment after clicking on the assignment you view it and then you can be able to attempt it you see an option for attempting that's where you'll be able to submit the work so for me as a teacher i can see how many have handed in the work i can see those who are going to qualify he has frozen hello yes uh to add on rogers's point on certificate we we are going to design attendance form that we are going to share during the training like so for those ones who attended the first two days including this you can submit twice you can submit but then for those ones who have not yet attended and i'll only share this link during the training not going to share on the whatsapp group i'm not going to share on people's email i'm going to share this link during training so that you get it you follow the link you register you put your put your name and then uh i mean sign in the attendance and hand it over so that we know who has been consistent in the attendance and we can make the the the certificates for we don't want to make certificates for people who are who are attending a halfway or who are coming who are just showing up and disappearing so as you join the training we are going to make the certificates but make sure that you hand in the attendance i'm going i'm making the form now and share with the team thank you all right then it's on another note we are also i strongly recommend people to join into zoom with their email accounts because they have reports for all the classes but most of the people are joining in as guests they are not using their accounts so we really cannot ascertain who because some people are joining today with one name and then tomorrow with another i recommend you to use your emails so that it is easier and we have more information we also can easily get back to you if you join with your email in case of anything moses maybe uh some people are i've have borrowed the device they're using so it may be a little bit tricky but i think the attendance will give you because they are going to input that all right so the attendance will give you the right uh the right people because they will when they fill in the attendance form they will put in their emails there all right thank you so much dennis let me respond to a few queries here and then we'll close the meeting yes code from kisa uh the other thing is that if members come in and they when immediately the journey they rename themselves we can take attendance like the attendance of today i took it i know that someone their phones their initials and so on let them use their real names that is very good thank you for noting i always advise people to rename themselves to something they prefer being called it also helps us when we are communicating i know who i am talking to yes habarujira yes please oh thank you so much i really am enjoying these lessons and i'm feeling so great so i i i was

set everything is set now we are live on youtube and uh we are recording and the co-hosts have been granted the rights so now we can start okay so uh good evening members this is rojas mukharire i am the national coordinator for the ict teachers association and today  now hey let me try to mute someone here okay so okay so i've muted someone was talking so i was saying that uh i'm called radius from kaliri and i'm your host today but you're not be seeing me every day some days you'll be seeing the other facilitators for the various sessions you're going to be having i want to welcome all the members who are here we are going to be sending some survey at the end of the session so that you can uh give us some feedback on the sessions how they are moving so that we can be able to cater for you yeah so i'm going to start by having a quick presentation here  i'm going to have a presentation here quickly to walk through what we discussed earlier on and then after that i'm going to invite my colleagues to come in so we want to do this one quickly so that we catch up okay so we are having the teachers e-learning training it is a program which is going to be running for two weeks it has been uh initiated organized by 85 for christian school on association teachers and schools under the christian christian schools and uh we are it is being facilitated by the ict child association a team of teachers of technology it is going to be running for two weeks and there are some contacts here so the main objective which you can see here is to prepare teachers for the new number of e-classes you have been hearing about this word the new normal and you know as is something which came in it's a new terminology which came in during the period of coverage so that's the it is something that we need to embrace okay so um so that is the quick introduction it has been organized focusing on e-learning and in the under the training is coming in recently the president of uganda gave a speech and told us that um schools were actually supposed to not give any time for them when they were open but the churches were told to wait for 60 days schools i did here very well so we are really there in a period of uncertainty should our learners continue being either at home or we should engage them to continue reading revising uh so that by time they call them back they can remember where they ended and they can even they can easily because sometimes they give a little time yeah so i think it is a very good thing that we can learn how to engage the learners remotely using e-learning so that is why we this project is here so that teachers can be given the tools skills so that they can start  conducting some lessons to ensure continuity of learning so we already having uh another program for students uh there's a program for for students running even right now uh if you go to youtube i think the lessons have ended yeah i think the lessons have ended but if you go to uh christian school announcation channel on youtube you'll see several videos which are there lessons which are going on by different teachers so what we want is to transform uh to transform all other teachers who have never done this so that they can be able to to also learn how to to start uh teaching lessons online uh so that is the objective to prepare you to be able to teach online like here i'm having teacher robina here teaching on zoom so if you have never done something like that this program is for you we want to give you all the tools as a teacher to prepare digital content to use e-learning platforms to collaborate with other teachers to manage students online to mark learner's work return it to them so that is what that is our our objective so we are going to be giving you

learners so you are almost welcome in this session first of all allow me to extend a vote of thanks to our partners they have played a very killer in this training edify is a strong partner that has been supporting christian schools in uganda for the last four years and they have been sponsoring many programs and today they are sponsoring all our teachers to learn how to use computers to learn how to teach learners online on the computer by using zoom and many other programs and the our pattern is edified thank you so much but i would like to thank our blogger dennis or mario who is in charge of these programs who has been suppressing us trying to make this happen at the same time we wish to thank our partner ipow with the leadership of mr mccarter we thank you so much for this wonderful work i know you are learning two programs that go that is online lessons for our learners at the same time training all our teachers to learn how to teach online we thank you so much for the

learners i know you are heroes president nelson mandela once said that if you want to destroy the nation destroy education destroy schools destroy teachers so i know you are playing a very big role in the transformation of this nation so we thank you so much we cannot take your contribution to education sector for granted without teachers of course nolan can take place so we thank you we love you we strongly support you that's why we have invited you on this training i continue to let you know that you should not lose hope in this trying moment somehow somewhere our government has not supported us as we expected but at least god is on our side jesus is our savior he will create a way for us now on this program that you have english i know when you take it with one heart you will not remain in the same you there is some value that is going to be added on you as schools will open you'll be able to teach learners even when you're at home so dear colleagues there is no way we can avoid the ict usage there is no way we can avoid education technology now with the pandemic of coffee things have not remained the same we might not know we might not use chalk anymore so take this opportunity very well ed fires really put a lot of money he has paid a lot of money for you to see that you learn how to teach if you have gone for if you if you are to pay you will pay more money so that's why i'm very grateful for 35 and our partner vital so we thank you so much i wish you a successful uh training and i wish to thank and also wish the trainers to carry on the work of their world go almighty god bless you all we love you so much thank you okay uh thank you very much uh mr benedict for that message okay now let us hear from mr dennis uh briefly about from 85 and then charlie getting back onto the problem you said mr dennis okay thank you rogers i don't want to take a lot of time no i've talked to i think most of you during the first session i just want to give you a word of encouragement that uh right now this is only up this is the only option that we have to reach out to the learners and we are so privileged as teachers that to actually get this opportunity to be able to reach out to learners online and by the way moment the schools reopen i don't know this year or next year i don't know when but the moment it opens most schools will be looking for teachers who are capable of teaching online and most parents will be looking for schools that are capable of teaching online so once you have this knowledge once you have this skill just know it is an opportunity for you to continue to work a lot of teachers are crying that we don't have money we need help we need help but we realize that this is the one help that we can give you and you will ne you will never have to ask for it anymore so with this opportunity i request you that you take it with a keen interest make sure that you don't miss anything because these guys are going to give you the best so work with them try to learn everything my motto always is that learn as long as you are still alive learning doesn't stop and the more skills you get the more opportunities you have out there tomorrow school may say i want a teacher who does this and this and that and if you've been learning all your life you you'll realize that you cannot fail to they you cannot fail in any interview in fact you will not have to do interviews so uh let us let us take this with a keen interest let us try not to miss any any session because at the end of the day we are we we are praying and like and hoping that you will be our light out there we don't want to run our the online classes forever we want to hand it over to you so you can make a little bit of money out of it those who knew how to do online lesson in the first lockdown they made a lot of money others would check parents ten thousand per lesson on others with just 20 depending on where they are located and they were surviving stop let's take this opportunity to learn from these guys who have did who have sacrificed their time to teach you learn as much as you can and we are always here to support as edify when you reach out as a teacher for any sort of training for your school for yourself we are ready to give you the only thing we want from you is your sacrifice your time and maybe a little bit of contribution in terms of data especially during this lockdown in terms of data and only those two so thank you so much you are all welcome this is a program run by itau and uh coordinated by christian school honors association we want to just say we are so grateful to to you you guys the itau team school of christian school honors team you have done a great job in mobilization in reaching out to

want to first refer the members to uh the websites those especially those who are not in the morning if you want to learn more about edify you go to uh what you call edify.org now they deserve to call um some members maybe uh i don't know because we are from different places yeah so but one of the key things that you need to learn is how to use the internet that is actually a very important skill so you should learn how to use the internet as a teacher how to how do you use the internet if you go to the to the internet yeah and you have a computer with the internet how do you use that internet you use it for uh to benefit you or you only know maybe to go and watch songs on youtube or what you should learn how to use the internet to work for you so there is something known as a browser you can open a browser we have many browsers we have firefox we have chrome we have uh microsoft edge these ones are known as browsers so when you open one you should be able to open a browser like this so you type in edify.org and you can be able to read more about edify what they do and also read about where they work they work in different parts of the the country uh you can read about the they are their core values yeah so let us learn about these organizations and also you can read more about the christian school announcement of uganda you read about how do you become a member as a school read about to the the uh about them how you become a member you get the contacts the contacts of mr sas are there on the website uh and also yeah so you'll be able to read more about them then you can also get to know more information about ital what they do and and that so that was just from the first session so okay so uh at this time um i'm going to give the the various facilitators here a chance to give briefly greet us and then i'll be coming back to share more about the various platforms and we are going to be enrolling some members uh as we shall be winding up so let me get um  um

their lives like one of our speakers has said it for me you'll be meeting me uh probably next week on a topic that is on on our program i thank all the participants for this willingness to learn and to cause change and impact in our schools amidst this pandemic thank you very much i believe that after these trainings we are going to have a very big impact in our institutions of learning with this pandemic this is the right way to go in schools where people are still running away from technology please let us inform our friends and colleagues that technology is now the way to go there is no way we can move on without technology thank you very much once again the host and the facilitators plus the administrators have a nice evening uh thank you very much mr mukherjee thank you very much hey

are as well the facilitators of this are the main host rogers like welcome everyone to this has been the topics that have been arranged are quite many but uh i would expect that you persevere through and gain the knowledge so that you can transform the same knowledge to anna's in your school or even beyond school if you're requested for such ice city is already in our middle east it came to stay and the only way we can benefit from it is to embrace it failure to embrace ict because we are using phones and the phones have a lot of apps that can do as many things as possible so let us use the same in our teaching and learning to help this young generation who are already in the technology not as the digital immigrants for me whenever i'm speaking to teachers sometimes i say they we are digital immigrants some of the teachers are bigger trunks because technology wasn't they are during the time we were born but these young people are growing with the technology around them it is a yeah kid can get your phone and then start doing as many things as possible with it and you might even wonder what that young kid is doing so let us welcome the trainers the facilitators work with

but afterwards we shall remain in the google group the google group will be a mailing list uh where in case we have a new opportunity opportunity a given school wants digital teachers we shall be sending an email to the google the google group is the mailing list so anyone who is in the google group gets an email um of even this particular training we sent so we have a sofa 295 members in the google group and we are going to be adding all of you uh we have uh 660 teachers who have applied to be part of this training 660 you are among them so all these 606 teachers are going to be added to the google group and we are going to be adding sharing with you opportunities uh through that google group even after the training is over anything to do with the edify an opportunity we shall be sharing with you uh through the google group so we are going to be adding you there so we have the go classroom we have the whatsapp we have the the google group okay so along the way we shall teach you more about to uh creating your youtube channel which i'll teach you about calibri colibri uh calibri library in the in the morning i was trying to open it and it was not happening but it is there it is opening um we have a colibri installation on the website of christian school and association we're going to be teaching you more about how coding can be used at your school to be a good digital library uh for you which you can view to support uh e-learning okay so let's now right now um it is time up we are we are going to look at um a few hands and uh we shall be closing within around 10 minutes if you have any supplement or any question now from the teachers please i'm not seeing anyone's hand up i'm giving a chance to the only uh we are giving a chance to only the first so we have mr dissan cayamba and then you you speak all right thank you so much rogers can you hear me yes thank you so much rogers for the session i'm so grateful uh mainly i wanted to ask about saturday's program according to how you told us in the morning yes some teachers they are so so busy doing this and that that's why you're giving just one hour but then on saturday how long will it be in that we can prepare ourselves because we need no area and then we time ourselves and we know how many hours are we going to have in the session and then what are we going to do in our no more our normal other staff thank you so much okay saturday session for now is two hours and the saturday session is just going to be a recap of the week's work and extra practice we shall not be teaching anything new on saturday uh so if someone has missed out to the sessions during the week and he comes on saturday he can still get to know what we thought we learned and then those ones who may be behind will be helping others and by the way we shall be encouraging you to share screen we want to see what you're doing the other one says he tells him share screen we are going to be having break our sections some things you'll be doing them in groups so we are going to design a training whereby you are the participants at the center we don't want to just be here to come and lecture you we shall be grouping you we give you a task in a group we make breakout sessions and you do saturday is going to be for extra practice and to just nothing new is being added on saturday general practice question and answer and uh supporting members who may have missed some sessions during the week so we are starting at nine up to eleven only two hours on saturday okay any other question uh any hand  mr willy meanwhile i want to request mr i want to request mr emma root please look at the chat and see if there are some questions there that you can raise here and we we talk about them you read through the messages in the chat and then you identify some questions uh mr winnie yes yes you have behind us yes yeah thank you very much for this session sincere i'm very glad that you have called upon the teachers to embrace this new normal i guess my colleagues who are on this session they let us just put in our time let us be committed because this only to go as mr guard isaac said say that we can continue with our our teachings are still at home we don't know when the schools could be open we call upon now we shall be encouraging our heads say that they also embrace this new normal and we can still conduct our lessons so i do thank you really thank you for this session okay you're welcome okay so we have only three hands and no more hand only this actually two hands now the people who are

chance for speaking you because i don't know how i can call you because you are called the techno so i don't know how i can call you let me give mr joke if you know you are your name is taking you please rename yourself rename yourself click on your name be somewhere where there is renamed and then you make sure you put your name let us have a sergeant yes mr rosa rodgers good evening and all the members good evening yeah thank you very much for these evening sessions i just want to appreciate unless i request all members let's take these opportunities and let's find time i have one question for you mr rodgers yeah some of us are using smartphone are we can we are we going to be able to share our screen as well as the questions thank you okay so your question is are you able to share your screen so using your phone i'm going to share my phone i also have my phone on so i'm going to share my screen i'm going to share my screen here and you see it is possible you can share and i've been seeing some teachers teaching so this is my my screen i'm sharing my screen you can share your screen using the using the what using your phone zoom can share screen and when you share a screen uh you this is the app i was talking about on google classroom so you can still open it google classroom then i can touch here and then i say during the class and then i put in my class called and i type it in and i join the class so if you're using a phone just go to google play store just go to google play store google play store is this app here which has this thing known as play store this one then you search for google classroom and after searching for google classroom you'll see the app you install it you open and you'll be there then you touch this button you put in your class code uh during the class you type in that code which you wrote down and you'll be ready to do the assignment this evening so you can share your screen and that is what i wanted to let you know okay just get any other question i think that one has been answered thank you welcome any other question okay mr moroso now you end up with these questions from the chat and then we we close mr maruti yes please i'm hearing you yes uh questions for any questions from the chat uh there is a question from mr bennett he's asking uh i think he asked this question when mr edwin was speaking is asking any opportunity is asking that our children learning coding if so which language okay children learning coding if so which language yes uh children are learning coding we have introduced coding on the children's timetable um the the students timetable for lessons that is the one i've shared it on the screen there that is the time table for lessons and i would encourage the teachers here to all go and log in some of those lessons and observe what is happening uh we have normally have four sessions in the whole day we have a lesson at nine a lesson at eleven a lesson at two and also a lesson at four for all classes from baby class up to senior five go into a lesson of your interest and observe how the teacher is conducting the lesson how the teacher prepared her powerpoint how the teacher is responding to the learners muting and animating how the teacher is teaching and managing time on zoom go and observe those lessons it is very good to learn from experience coding takes place every tuesday from four tomorrow and also we have another session uh on wednesday now coding is programming developing a child is innovative mindset coding is a new language that all children should learn in the new era because if you go abroad you find learners are learning programming when they are still when they are still very young so we have we have introduced coding and recording uh is to do with algorithm design uh algorithm design and algorithm is an algorithm is a is what makes a pro a computer program so the the language that is used we use what you call scratch scratch yeah scratch and learners can learn how to program and make very good programs now the coding concepts behind scratch can be applied even in other languages because we have things like loops we have things like variables we have things all those things which are in modern programming languages are there so we are going to be having a session tomorrow and i would like you to encourage your learners we have partners from uh mindset quarters and africa for the week who are going to be teaching learners coding and they are going to be using scratch so you can visit africa.weekly.org to learn more about the kind of coding that we are going to be teaching the learners okay any other question mr emolut yes uh another question is somebody is asking you to kindly share the statistics of registered districts which are represented so far in this program the statistics of the registered districts which are represented so far yes by the participants hey by the participants i think so okay i don't know why he wants that but let me just show him something small i will not refuse to show you something small so we have here by gender we have 69 percent are female and 32 percent are male we have several districts here we don't have a graph but we have all districts  [Applause]  i will not just summarize the statistics but the entire country is represented in this particular and most of the people are primary teachers 350 of them we have secondary then we also have nursery secondary at 37 percent and many of the teachers here have never taught online that is 74 percent then we have 25 percent they have taught online 25 percent means these 25 will be supporting you so it's not going to be only the facilitators even federal teachers are going to be uh supporting you so that is the answer to that question any other question  yes somebody's asking should we expect a certificate of participation and compilation at the end of the training okay let me ask you a question if we you have two people who want a job in your office they want to be online tutors one person brings a certificate and then another gives you a link to a youtube channel with 200 lessons that the teacher has been teaching whom will you give a job confidently the one with a paper with nothing to show or the one with digital content where i don't even need a cv this world now has changed people are looking at competencies not papers people are looking at what you can do even when you go for interviews these days you can have a master's and they give a job to a diploma holder if the one who has the diploma holders showing them that he has the experience and he has something to show there is no certificate the certificate is going to be your output what do you have to show after the training in terms of skills in terms of digital content created and that is what is going to give you opportunities not a paper so there's no plan for a certificate what we plan is to make to transform you to a digital teacher the certificate will be the content you are going to create any other question are they over uh somebody's asked i was asking for a registration link but it has been shared on the on that chat so i don't see any other questions and irene they have lifted their hands since it's been a while let them first ask their questions okay just have legion and iron and then we close irene will give us a closing prayer as well roley let's meet newton uh yes lulay is unable to speak irene hello good evening everybody and thank you for the good work you're doing my question is this what platform are you using for the registration are you using red cap because you quickly showed us a dashboard so i'm interested to know what you're using to get your statistics and your graphs and pie charts ready okay thank you very much actually one of the things which is going to constitute today's assignment is going to be your question so you are going to go to gogo.com you will go to google.com and you search for google forms google forms is a free tool it's part of the google tools you can create a form and immediately it can give you analysis so you click on google phones and click on go to forms and create a form so yeah you're going to create for us a form as part of the assignment for today you go to google form and you click on blank and you create a form now this google phone schools have been using it a lot during this period of coming when senior results came out many schools created google forms to receive applications from the from the learners from the p7 students so you come here and you say application form so the assignment for today is going to be for you to create an application form for your school admission form using google forms so you're going to create an animation form admission form so you are going to put their questions uh you can go to the ict teachers website we have uh we have put an article i see teachers uganda you can search for sexy as a gun on google we have put an article with all that several registration forms from different schools that they have been making uh if you have a a child who dp7 and you want an admission uh you will just apply through those forms schools have been sharing these forms on their websites and other areas so you are going to go to google forms you say admission form then you come here you type a question you ask a person's name and then you specify whether it should be a short answer or a paragraph or an objective then at the end of the day google forms is going to do for you they when you click on responses it's going to give you the analysis yeah so that is one of the things that you should do i wanted to refer to you to some other forms that other schools have done on the website of ict teachers that you can be able to to get an inspiration on what you can do yeah so that is the that is the water we are using for uh making this home a free tool that is easy after you have made the form you click on the send button and you copy the link this link is the one that you send to people to apply uh or to register yeah so you can use it to create service so on the other side of my city teachers there is an article here there is an article called schools turn to online admission forms amidst covet so when you go to that article you are going to see several application forms uh set maria goretti cartendy cetera high school chitanda there is a hilton high school trinity college in a bingo there are very many school ninja secondary school uganda matas some of them have used the other form creators but most of them have used the google forms google forms have been the most so for us we don't have to go here to put them in one place so that parents are nabi sunset girls all these schools have been using google phones and um they have used google forms to create these admission forms uh which they are using to get uh syrian candidates so they can be able to know how many candies so these are the homes that one is for trinity college uh this one is for uganda matas this is for san diego nazareth this is um these are different homes by different schools and uh they create a simple form they are spelling as indexing number whether they are from which school the students fill in and they get the results when you after they are filled in the form you will get all the responses also as an excel sheet you can export it as an excel sheet you you click on responses and then you export it as an excel sheet and then you can summarize all your information so that is a good question okay i think members let us end there [Applause] yes there is uh i think one last question somebody is asking you to guide him on how to share the screen using a mobile device how to share the screen using a mobile device yes okay i think that is going to be uh handled during tomorrow we are going to be looking at at zoom yeah we shall help make a tutorial to show you but uh down here on the phone there is somewhere where there is a share so you just touch on that button called the share and then from there you scroll you'll see where there is a screen and then you click on screen and click on start now and then it shares so it is uh it is a page quite easy you can be able to share your screen and uh members can be able to see what you are sharing so that is something that you can do we shall do tomorrow morning during the zoom session okay i think let us end let us just have a closing prayer because questions will not end let us get more questions in the whatsapp group alice is just to pray for us just pray for us alice national alice hello can you see me yes i think yes we can see you okay thank you very much i had a question but maybe tomorrow let me just pray as you have seen okay lord father thank you thank you for this session thank you for helping us at least develop this from our mind not to remain redundant in this period thank you very much guide us and we proceed and become successful in it in jesus wonderful mighty name we have prayed amen uh amen you can turn on your video we take a group photo here for launching the program very well you can turn on your video and you say bye bye turn on your video turn on your video turn on your video we are taking some group photos here for a successful launch of the program thank you very much for uh being uh turning uh turning up for this bachelor training ah okay so i'm taking the photo so you can say thank you very much for joining bye bye have a nice evening thank you very much teachers let us become digital teachers uh yeah let us become teachers and uh god will bless us with the skills that we need uh thank you very much from all parts of the country uh for joining in for this special session uh let us be here to be able to share even you who knows something you will be given a chance to share with others so that is going to be very good thank you very much god bless you all god bless you too regis god bless you all see you tomorrow thank you so much to you bless you all okay thank you have a nice evening  oh
 hello and welcome to OG live I'm Alan Lavine and I'm running the show today but I'm really not in charge of anything but I'm really excited to bring you this project that I've been following from Dan Maguire and and Katherine cure are are here with us to tell us all about uh this amazing effort that's going on um with bringing uh putting Oar to use uh for elementary learning in in Africa and so I'm not going to try to explain it but we're just gonna have a casual conversation here and this of course will be recorded and first of all you know sadly disappointed that we can't make this work at the conference next week for o Global but this is sort of a way to open things up and so hello and and welcome um I I'll start I'm GNA start with Katherine Dan comes first but but Katherine it's great to have you here uh tuning in from South Africa and in a very interesting location right yes I'm in a I'm in a guest house in the Maro so we're in the Northwest Province so I'm having to borrow ethernet um it's 36 degrees today so yeah it's a fairly 36 degrees Celsius what's that in Fahrenheit Dan hot upper 90s probably hot that's why I'm sort of yeah so um but thank you uh it's wonderful to be here and I I guess it's this kind of remote area with um we have issues with electricity as well as with uh Wi-Fi connectivity and those are exactly the kinds of problems that the Moodle box has been designed to uh solve in terms of the challenges of being in poor areas with a lack of resources and I was incredibly blessed that Dan called me and said hey I've got this project already going in in Ghana would you like to join us in South Africa and um and bring South Africa on board so it was just really very exciting thank you thank you I'm really Keen to learn about moodle boox I I've followed a little bit from Dan but can you tell us about the the steam Foundation that that is your organization seed funded by SE stiff Tang which is the german-based nonprofit we've always had a very strong focus on Science Education and under resource schools and what we find is that the context between the global South and the global North is so very very different that solutions for the global North are just not applicable in the global South um so we've been really we loved the concept we loved how they looked at Hands-On experimentation um but we've been really trying to ensure that we solve it in terms of enabling very strong lesson plans for teachers where we consider our teacher to be our first learner um and then obviously during the pandemic we pivoted to online um and then we've been looking at various ls's and more sort of Blended learning approaches but one of our key problems is is that it just breaks down when you are now dealing with a remote area with intermittent electricity with little to no cellular signal you know you might be in areas where there's literally no no mobile s signal so how do you do that and then obviously that's that's where the Moodle box and its promise comes into play that you can run it off a power bank obviously somewhere along the line you need data and connectivity but it can be that the teacher uses the cell phone downloads puts it onto the Moodle box and then the Moodle box basically which is a credit card sized you know um Raspberry Pi it's it it's basically a portable server and then it starts it it's it's it's its own little Wi-Fi there we go Dan's got one and um in South Africa we've also as you can see we're 36 degrees and we not one of the um hottest places in Africa so the case that we bought has a little fan as well um so that we can sort of work with it but we've been you know looking at all the different um challenges around that and this really is um is very very exciting in ter terms of its promise because obviously not every school is like that but if we cannot solve for the poorest and least resourced schools then you cannot actually scale to the whole country and those are the schools with the greatest need for equipment often the logistics of getting there we've got a lot of mountainous terrain we've got River Crossings I mean when we've delivered books or in other projects you've had to get 4x4s um with you know River Crossing capabilities and Mountain whereas something like this is really solves a lot lot of those a lot of those challenges and we now having to get it to work within the country this is so exciting and so uh we're going to see more hopefully and learn more about this and Dan thank you for showing the Box I've been eager to see one but hello and welcome your OE artist I love that title but tell us a little bit about yourself yes I um the title I will credit to my wife Casey she was a she we were on a walk one day and she said you know how do I tell people what you do no nobody understands that I started so it's all about she said well are you then kind of like an OE artist I said well yeah I kind of like that let's go with that so um I really do like that anyway um so I've been doing professional development for teachers relative to the use of a digital tools specifically open- Source Learning Management Systems and then uh added in Oar in about 2011 and I've been doing that all through the pandemic but what was really interesting was a little over a year ago when I started exploring the Moodle box this device that I just held up which is a version of Moodle which is the um learning management system which is most widely used all across the globe um the open University in UK uses it most of the universities in South Africa use it there it's used by universities all over the world and as Katherine so nicely put it we do have to those solve for those who have the least resources and so that's what the Moodle box does so I was looking at that and trying to figure out how it works and how we can apply it and I happened on LinkedIn to meet up with Peter amab who lives in tamali Ghana and he has started a several years ago a nonprofit to acquire resources for his school and the neighboring schools in his Northern um suburb part of tamale and I we connected and I chat I said would you be interested in looking at maybe using this technology device and he said yes let's try it and it's just been delightful working with him he's an incredible talented Innovative teacher that is just um so dedicated and he has helped me learn how to apply this in classrooms so we've built this over the year and we've got we we as Katherine pointed out tried various devices um but one of the issues we struggled with is what was the what was the the best device to use with students in the to access the um the Moodle box in the classroom and we ended up after experimenting with cell phones and various other and laptops settling on a a 10-inch tablet which we were able to acquire in tamale and um then so we we developed that device and then I started showing Peter how to add content onto the Moodle box so the students could access it and we we then found African story book which is a phenomenal organization that was founded by sad the South African Institute for distance education several years ago and it's probably one of the largest Oar repositories that lots of people at OE Global don't know about primarily because it's all uh early literacy primary books picture books um but we're able to download those put them on the Moodle box and um the students loved seeing them they're bright in color and then Peter found that on African story book they actually have books in dagbani I'd never heard of the kingdom of Deon which has been in existence for many centuries and it's it's the the area around tamali and all of the people in that area speak D bani well that's their first language and they were he was able to find books on African story book in dag bani which he was able to put on to the Moodle box so now the students are looking at their mother tongue on in books on their devices which is phenomenal for them these are students who had never had a device in their hands who their families don't own electronic devices there is not Internet available in the area so now these fifth graders can look at their their mother tongue on their own devices this is like a wow this is this is big not only that but we can take the books that are on African story book in English and translate them into dagani so that's just a matter of find I I tried it in I tried doing it with chat GPT and chat GPT doesn't get de Bon so but so we're relying do the Translating but um and then then we go on to add assessments because that's one of the things about the learning man systems is that you can also add assessments because as a teacher we know that just presenting the book to the student that is just only the first step you know has the student actually read the book do they understand it what are their misunderstandings as they're reading the book this is true at every level of Education we have to find out what this so we use the assessment tools in the learning management system to do that because it's open source and because the content is all o we can translate it into debani the teacher can modify it for the specific needs of their students we don't have to rely on you know the Legacy Publishers to provide us with the assessment the teacher can do that and I'll show you an example of that at some point here too how how we can actually do that but I'll pause and that let you ask a question I I just think um it's worth explaining this this situation that exist in Ghana and and South Africa of of um as I understand it of mandating Education in local languages which is commendable um but leaving teachers to figure it out on their own and and so what what what what do teachers typically do when they're forced to do this and what are they able to do now Katherine do you want to speak to that a bit can't sure I I can't really speak so much for the G situation but in South Africa we have 11 Different official languages and only quite recently have we really realized the impact of not starting in your sort of in your mother tongue you know we also so and and and the importance of that so the reality is there are publishing books out there but again you've got issues of logistics distri distribution um access in terms of accessibility in terms of price point and so on and that is where something like being able to take a digital book because with one Moodle box you can have a 100 books 200 books you know there are organizations like book Dash as well which um is very um is is translating into mother tongues and and story Weaver but again if you wanting they come with straight story books they're not going to be doing using a learning management system and so on so yes there's a there is a big deficit and I think in the presentation Dan it was something like 43% of households in South Africa don't even have a single book so if you are you know that is that is a massive problem and we see it now you know impacting on the literacy um and the literacy levels um that we are not performing as well as we should in terms of in pearls Tims all of the the international standardized tests and there is now a big Drive especially in the early years and um up up until recently your kindergarten year was was your cres your Early Education Centers were actually handled by the Department of Social Development we had lots of small centers with not necessarily uh women who were particularly well predominantly women obviously and now that's recently been Incorporated within the department of basic education so kindergart was never a formal year of schooling it was it was often being run by a lot of independent people in groups and there's again this just highlights how critical those early literacy books are and we know it's a similar situation with the 11 languages in um in Ghana as well Dan same interesting that that there's the same number both Ghana and South Africa have 11 offal and and English is one of the both countries you know so um and as Peter has pointed out I said well I mean doesn't the Department of Education send you books and he said well yeah sometimes send us 10 books and rarely in De Bon because as a practical matter how is a country the Department of Education in a country that's struggling to you know meet its basic needs in some cases how are they going to afford to print large quantities of books in 11 different languages I mean that that's almost going to be hard to do if they had the money as Katherine pointed out then delivering of them becomes an issue so digital um LMS is really really address a huge problem and yeah and that's true of all over Africa and it's also true in South Asia and lots of places in the world where where uh the you know the the literacy people are figuring out that it's better to teach kids as Katherine pointed out in their mother tongue first how to read and then introduce the dominant official language of the government um then we have multilingual kids which is what we want uh but trying to force them to learn a new language as they're learning this concept of well you know c a means cat well what's a cat if if that's not in your language you know it's sort of obvious when you think about it but we've been doing it the wrong way for many years exactly well let's let's give us oh go ahead kther no I think one of the other the other things I'm wanting to highlight is that English is a bad as non-transparent a language as you get you know most of your African languages or Africans what you read is what you say you know you don't have said spelled you know said should be S not S A you know so you know so youve You' you've got the complexity of English being the dominant language or you know the lingua franka as it were of the world but now it's an extraordinar difficult language even for a first language English English speaker to learn to read and write because it's just grabbed every noun from every other country in the world um and not you know so it's a very non-transparent language and that that also that just adds to the complexity so now you're having to learn a different language from your mother tongue and it's non-transparent so your capacity to learn quite quickly is is obviously impacted and what's been really exciting I was recently at a naski conference the National Association for social change entities and education and the University of celos their recept group re have actually created a template for working out at the end of let's say kindergarten or grade one if you is CLA or isizulu how many words should you have mastered and they actually went all the way back to scratch and they've created a very exciting methodology for understanding because you know the funders who are coming in are saying well okay so in mother tongue what what should we be expecting what are the benchmarks how how do we assess the child um how many words should they have mastered and so on so um one of the uh women involved in the research gave us a very exciting presentation which um um like really and and what was interesting was that again it's a global South solution it's got nothing you know they said these methodologies will not work in this country and they went all the way back down to scratch and they've created a whole new template so that's exciting yes all right so let's uh you don't mind Dan let let's get a sense about um how this all works you're going to do a little bit of screen sharing demo right sure happy to I love yes so this is um obviously the lion runs and walks it's a first year reading book that is popular all over the world this one is actually written in uh Cambodia I think um by the south Asia and it's been translated into lots of different languages I'll just run through it real quick here so the lion runs cow walks FR in water all right so obviously this is very concrete animals things water air would the things we want to teach students uh in the beginning now we took this book and um I we worked with Chad GPT and I asked Nya for some help in fixing it and this is what it looks like when you translate it into isosa all right we just had to reformat it a little bit but again it shows up pretty much the same I'm not going to try to pronounce those words but anyway all right so but now we have that that's actually how easy it is really uh again we just need to have a few um you know thankfully we have Nya to translate this and make it right um and we're working with limited languages but it's a it's a pattern and it's a model that I think we can expand on and use in other places we've done the same thing with d Bonnie in um in in Ghana I don't actually have one of those to pull up for you but now let me jump to the other capabilities of the Moodle box that I'd like to show you so okay so now first question is this says name the insect so this is actually we're using the stem Concepts this is science we're naming insects and which when we're talking about the r level as which is what neoya calls her kindergarten for reception year which is a term I actually like so it says name the insect so the mle box and this is a feature that's available both in Moodle and on Moodle box there's a capability of let's see if I play this did that could you hear that audio no I think we didn't get the shared audio but okay we can imagine yeah yeah but I I that was my voice trying to say this word umaka the point is that the student is able to so the question is name the insect and so they get an audio prompt so now we're asking them to do is say which one of these words did I just say and they choose this one and they get this prompt so and if I click that it's it's actually there that's going to say where we're very proud of you good choice and so they get an audio prompt for confirming that they got the answer right now what's I think really important here is because this is um OE the content on here I created this in my voice but we want the teachers to create it in their voice because obviously the kids in the Western Cape are going to respond better I think to their teacher's voice than you know an old grandfather from Minnesota grandfather type I don't actually have grandkids yet but you know I think that'll work but the point is the teacher gets to choose the teacher could hire an actor to to do it if they want if the department will pay for it of course but the key is that they get voice prompts they get voice confirmation on their choice they get and then we can do some video um prompts too here's the same thing you know how many uh I don't know if you can say that Katherine that's the it's a COA word for butterfly this probably only makes as much sense as butterfly does for a name of this animal um small for me to see oh sorry but yeah it's something like you know but and and here's where I try to pronounce that and again so this is what happens student answers wrong oh the question is how many of them are there so the the answer is there's one two so the student answers three no that's that's three and the correct answer and we can give them a prompt I if I played this this would be that's a video a video response of me saying oops you'll have to try a different one so the our level students get audio prompts video prompts all of these things then can be recreated by their teacher in the classroom using the teacher's own um face and voice to do that um that's this is one of the really powerful tools of being able to use the mood box because these are all tools that are built into the mood box there's no additional yeah nothing needs to be added so everything that you can do in Moodle in terms of this interaction is run off of the the Moodle box locally yeah yep so it's incredibly powerful and it provides all the one thing the Moodle box tends not to allow the plugins because obviously it's quite small so they do prefer no plugins though you are finding that Moodle itself is starting to look at our was we had a Moodle moot in South Africa recently which was very exciting which I attended and there um the found was saying that they are looking at their most popular plugins and trying to incorporate them into core Moodle because if it's that popular and that used then it really should be part of the platform so there is that distinction that you know you might that that there are some functionalities around plugins that you got to be aware of but hopefully the most important ones will be incorporated in future a and also is it doing the full like um you know keeping track of what individual students are doing um in terms okay oh absolutely that that's one of the other things we've done in in Ghana is pull up um uh student achievement Reports say we've created some math quizzes there too so Peter can actually show he can actually pull up and and create a Excel spreadsheet of how well each of his individual students are doing on the math quizes that he's been giving them and that's I'm GNA bet that the people in ACA that are visiting his classroom probably haven't seen that in Acra I think I think he's leading you know doing some cutting Ed stuff right and then uh I know a big piece of of the project is the uh professional development for teachers so they can so so if if um I'm a teacher a remote air with my Moodle box I can do some of these changes that you're describing in terms of all of them yeah okay that's that's the point of the professional development yeah is that we show them how to create a quiz how to make the modifications how to um add add content how to add quizzes um it's you know it's not it's not rocket science but again we're talking about elementary teachers who have anywhere from 20 to in some cases 40 students in their room and they're they're of course like everywhere in the world uh overworked and underpaid so whatever support we can give them to be able to do this and as Katherine was saying in some places in South Africa it's true all over but that the the amount of work we're requiring of our teachers for these to to introduce the future students of the world to literacy we're kind of doing it wrong I think we we need to provide more support the more support we can provide the better off everybody's yeah and I don't know I mean this is probably like I don't know if it's even possible but like let's say I've done some of these customizations um as a teacher um wouldn't they be of interest to other is is there some way of like you know organizing all this content into I see all the head noting so I'll stop and you'll answer well I guess that's part of that the Moodle the Moodle net project to enable sort of a a a repository of um of course of not only open education resources but also put into an LMS that are then available for anyone worldwide to use you know and adapt obviously as need be I mean that's the whole point of open education isn't it yeah there's um it's mood net yeah so just to confus people we have Moodle which is the learning management system Moodle box is the version of Moodle designed for a small server remote server mood net is the repository that Moodle and Martin Dugas has created to store Oar content if you pull up Moodle box to show people it's it it's it's still in it they're still building it out but there it's possible to add things things to it right now um you're and you're it's you can you can sort for things and search things and one of the nice things about moodlet is that if you're using Moodle you can add it to your course with a click click click boom it's in your course that's it it's all you have to do it's I think it's three clicks now if you're using if you're in the US or Canada and using something other than Moodle you can still download the content upload it to your LMS presuming that the proprietary LMS people have given you the ability to do that um it's still it's still possible to do uh you just need to have that the permissions to do it right uh and and just because people might ask like um are there uh creative comments licenses on this content or other kind of things which make this sharing apparent okay of course yeah it didn't they weren't necessarily on these test course that we put up here but yeah everything is CC licensed fantastic and so obviously and and and with the go ahead I was going to say with the appropriate license that is OAR because not all CC licenses are you know if it's ND it's no derivatives which means you can't even translate so yes has to be the correct one um in fact at the moment I've still got um I'm waiting for for some a previous work that I did where I'm I'm asking them to relicense it as oer and they initially wanted to Li re anyway so there's a lot of we we trying to get content that's been that is either copyright or is under a Creative Commons license but which isn't o to be re-released under license it enables us to use it in this in this um environment so um hopefully I'm going to get some good news on that soon so because that is the big issue is that um there are a lot of nonprofits or education departments out there who for whom copyright is just an automatic unthinking application it's not really it's like okay that's what you do with your material so there's a lot of conversations I'm having around in South Africa including with the tax authority to try and get that that those repositories released under as open education resource so that we all can benefit not just the few schools or even if it's a lot of schools who've whove who've benefited but yes it is a requirement with the project that we can only work with such materials I mean it's IL legal otherwise really you know that's the last thing any funder wants is that risk ah no know no but that brings up one of the other issues is is just the promotion of this whole concept o oar is still a secret for for too big too many people in the world especially when we're talking about K12 now Oar has tended to operate only in higher ed so far for the most part yes yeah I think is a fair thing to say and it's but that's we're actually that's only at the most 20% of the population of students and maybe you know Katherine's got some numbers where it's even less than that um you said at one point it's one out of 13 one 13 yeah so yeah here we'll do the math yeah but so yeah so far we haven't we haven't even really gotten to the to the the students in the world we're just dealing with the tip of the iceberg or the loow hanging fruit whatever metaphor you want you know we we need to get to the at the large group so if we want to actually promote Oar let's actually let's actually start where the students start we start them out in kindergarten by it'll be a no-brainer by the time they get to higher ed what're you know they'll have to use Oar and I I I think you know what what you've done is is replicable in in other places that need this so are you um are you already working or thinking of of other um parts of the world that you might put this into play uh yeah we were actually having conversations um I got off the phone an hour ago with a person in Kenya where we're starting there um and Via this Sean stiff Foundation which Katherine mentioned it as was started steam Foundation um we've been introduced to their South African I'm sorry South American uh Kaa department so stiff has a um a different organization that operates in the Spanish speaking world of South South America and you know again it's uh it's a slow process to get everybody changing um you know these K12 administrations have been doing things the same way for many many years all over the world so getting them to do it differently takes so all the promotion you can help us with Allan will appreciate I'm trying but like what what what kind of things would you need or what or where what should people do if they're interested in this um I think begin talking about it for one thing the other thing is at the higher ed level where lots of people who are going to hear this presentation first are going to say well okay so what should we do let's go over to the education department we train teachers and ask them if they know about Oar and ask their ask the people in the education departments if they're showing teachers how to use OE that would be the first thing what I found is that the answer is going to be for the most part not really maybe not yeah hard to say like you know yeah I'll say not really I'm pretty sure the answer is going to be that and most most education department and I did an analysis of research that was done by jet Education Services during the pandemic of what was available um for South African students and it was a vanishingly rare a tiny tiny s yes you've got African story book you've got sea of vula you've got Thunderbolts kids but that's pretty much it you run out so You' got a lot of stuff there that's simply not available so there's and and again you know steam has a traditional focus on science so there are some there is there is some material out there but there's a huge amount of material that isn't out there and so part of it is just to try and get people I think people and I'm working on OE policy um with universities as well and what I find is that people see it as giving and they don't realize that they can also take that there's a reciprocity you're not you're not merely giving what you create but you also are able to jump start you're able to get into a place where you know I was working on policy and I was saying hey I've got got all these policies from the Commonwealth of learning we can jumpstart this whole process we're not starting from okay Clause one we've got 10 policies here that are open education resources that we can work with um so there is a whole marketing and I think you know there's this red hearring of oh it's less quality believe you me if you're trying to put something out and you know that it can be you're going to be a lot more worried about what it looks like than if you're simply running it in a school or so on so I think part of it is just to shift that and to shift the fear um because you know it's it's it's relatively easy to put something up on an LMS um if you've got the content but if you don't have the content you first have to develop the content and then you put it onto the LMS you know so so I think that that is one thing the other challenge that I have been working with very much because of my history in um in development it's we actually are now working with a cellular manufacturer or they assemble they South African based they're throughout Africa but they are looking at creating for us as as large and robust a device as possible but one without any cellular capability because I know from working with the Sean shiang um funded organizations in South America that the provision of devices is a real problem in terms of theft so we've got a whole lot of other challenges we are looking at in terms of trying to make sure that the devices are not known to be that you know that you can't turn it into a cell phone for instance and then the other thing we have looked at as well is if you do provide the devices you know make sure you provide the the power Banks um and so on but that we are looking at switching profiles so you don't necessarily need a device a child but a deviser grade and the and the and the students can switch profiles so the there quite a lot of those kinds of things that I think we think of within our context and I know that the South American context is very similar in terms of poverty and the associated theft which again if you if you living in West Germany you don't think about because it's a small amount but I mean the devices I mean we're looking at the devices are coming in at round about 10% of of the of you know the volume um because again that is the solution that Africa needs so yes so those are those are the kinds of um because yes you know the last thing yes you know there's always the give you money but I know in the intelligence Community they say no no it's the analysis it's the understanding the money is the last thing you need to have solved the problem first you know and I think for me it would be getting people to to be a lot more consistent about um licensing education materials in K22 um as OE and not just automatically copyrighting them because then then you've got a lot of resources you can utilize and I'll just add add into that what Katherine is saying as as far as changing the mindsets and we're already spending Glo when I say we I mean globally education we're already spending the money it's not a ma it's not a matter of sustainability it's a matter of changing the flow of the money we
we're already spending lots of money more money than we need to actually the money should be diverted to creating the O books and the teacher professional development that's one thing so it's just a shift in that that some people think well it'll cost too much no it it's not a cost it's a shift of the focus of the money the other big thing the the of thinking that needs to change I think is in K12 we need an LMS we need or an LMS like and if we we would also like it to be open source that's why we we promote Moodle because it is an LMS and it's open source and again from a higher ed perspective is like well why do we need an LMS well because when we're talking about K12 we need to assess very frequently you noticed I showed you that quiz where we show a question and then we give them a prompt we give them feedback we see if they got it right as a as an elementary teacher you're assessing all day long you know and that's very different from higher ed where traditionally a lecture lectures all day long and then they assess two or three times a year the end of the semester well you know when you're an elementary teacher you're assessing as they come in the door and as they're leaving so that's why the LMS helps with that that part of the instructional process all right so we need to encourage the development of many more OE artist out there um and um and so I I really appreciate so much taking time out to to bring this to us and we hope we can get some more people interested in this fantastic work you're doing thank you thank you Alan thank you so much sure and this this this uh of course the the same link to watch this is now the recording so this is available for sharing right away and um just thank you again fantastic and we we hope we can keep this going thanks Alan sure excellent stay cool okay thank you so  much
okay members you're welcome thank you for coming in time  thank you very much for coming time for this session where we are going to be concluding with the subject of instructional videos a number of colleagues are joining us we are going to be sharing experiences and the members who have managed to do their assignments we are going to be looking at their work we had an assignment uh in the morning in the at midday we had an assignment on creating videos and a number of teachers have managed to do the assignment and we are going to also be having a demo how it was of how the assignment was supposed to be done those who have not yet done it you can still do it up to sunday the assignment will still be open so  okay so you're welcome so when what we are learning here is we are learning a number of things we are learning the uh the various uh tools that we need to we we're learning the various tools we are learning various tools that we need as teachers if we are to do e-learning if we have to run e-learning programs if we are to create digital content so we are going to be learning a number of tools and we shall be learning these tools by sharing experiences uh different teachers what they are doing and inspiring each other because that is the most important thing the most important thing is determination loving doing something with passion even if i uh i will give you all the notes about the zoom and you get a handout or a pamphlet about zoom but when you are not practicing it it will be a waste because you just keep it under your in your shelf so we should do  learn by doing and that's when we shall become so so we have a platform known as google classroom we shall be learning more about it next week but we are introducing these things even earlier so when you go to the internet and you search for classroom go to gogo.com classroom.gogo.com that is the link if you go to that link you should learn it if a teacher should learn that that that tool is very important classroom go to google.com if you if you search for google classroom or you go to that link you'll be able to find what you call gogo classroom those of you who have not yet enrolled make sure that you go to classroom.google.com then you log in with your email address and then you click on join class the class code is this one here this is the class code for joining the google classroom that we are using for this training google classroom is a free e-learning system there are many e-learning systems that schools use for example we have model we have we have many i mean others are custom systems but this one here what what model can do this one can do a lot of those tasks a teacher can put an assignment and learners can attempt to the assignment the teacher can put notes so  we you by now you are just students in this go classroom but by next week we shall be teaching you how to create your own google classroom as a teacher enroll learners and manage the classroom so there is a part where there is a stream where there are conversations uh people post there they need help they are headed then there is a pathway that is class classwork where all the classwork is organized in topics the topics are on the right you click on a topic and then you go to that particular topic so when you submit your work you go under classwork you don't go under stream you go under classwork then you click on a given assignment it will be an option for you to turn in your work so you click on add or create there's a link for adobe create that's what you click on maybe let me try to demonstrate it because we we want we don't have a lot of time we shall be we want you to be practicing on it before and you should be able to get your learners when you start using google classroom so it is something actually you can use even if it is not for online teaching for example in this class of help i am a student this is a class where i am a student so if i click on classwork i will find some exercises here so if i click on this exercise general knowledge assignment i can be able to open this one is used as a form yeah so there are there are several exercises here uh this one here the assignment so this is an assignment that they have so this is what you see when you are using google classroom then on the right if you have finished doing your work so the question is here attempt all the questions you can click on the question and then it opens and you can read your exam design exam that you have put so you can be able to fill it in this one was for editing you can fill in after that after you have finished you come back here and you click on is this part of add or create so you can upload you can create a new file or you can like in this case we wanted it to youtube video you could even put you can upload a link put the link and then after that you submit so this is something that you should know and i was just using that to give you some guidance so the work that we we gave in the morning google classroom when you go to the google classroom as a teacher you will click on the assignment and then you see this is the assignment and instructional videos there are 10 students who have done it 10 students have done the assignment out of 296. only 10 have done this so maybe i thought that maybe some people didn't know how to stand in so when i click on the 10 students who are handed in  let us mark some of them together here let us mark so we have george if i click on george his assignment is going to come here the video that he has done is going to come there so what what i'm doing is what you are going to be doing teacher as you start marking your learner's work so i click i can click on this this is the the judges assignment if i click on him it will open in a new tab it will open in a new tab here so i can be able to see this is just his this is if i click on his name it opens there and the things that he has been doing and his marks tells me that this george bernard is a very good student he's doing all the assignments he did the assignment on google form he got ninety percent he did the zuma assignment he got ninety we are marking by the way some of you don't think that we are not marking once we give you an assignment we are marking it at the end of the day your we shall be able to know your certificate whether you have a 20 or you have an 80 percent so presentation he did these things mean that he attached videos he has done and handed it so that is just i clicked on his name to see his performance now let me click on his assignment if i click on the assignment for for the one which we gave in at midday uh we can i can be able to see george bennett george bennett uh assignment on instructional videos this is the video that he has done he has uploaded it so um he has uploaded it so let me first play it so he has uploaded his video it shows here whatever work elena uploads whether it is a document or powerpoint or what it will always open in this area and then you can be able to see that video and then after seeing the video you can be able to give a mark on the other side so the video is the uh is loading here uh  okay uh video sometimes depends on on the network yeah so if it was a document you have finished uh loading we just wanted it to just open and uh and we see so down this side this is where i'm going to put the mark after seeing the video and there's a comment here that i added the video and i downloaded the slides presentation all in one so i can be able to give a comment and say uh thanks for that so google classroom is very important for us okay so sorry it is taking some time here to download okay it depends on my internet this site so  let me hope i'm on and i don't want to waste a lot of time i think our time has really gone in this so this is george bernard and then if i click on mr junior school ginger should be able to see their work um um what they have managed to do if i click on mafia unit i can be able to see the work that he has done is here computer basics and also he has put an archive here so this is what we we were supposed to do uh to submit the work very well into the google classroom so all these uh people have handed in others have not these ones who are here are the ones who have handed him and the others have not yet handed him yeah so this is the one for matthias cheer unit this is the video so okay i was playing them earlier but maybe because i want to zoom and sharing the screen so my bandwidth is a bit low yeah so basically let me end there on that uh let me just close this but i i saw them they were good videos uh they were good videos but yeah they are taking long load here yeah so okay so let me just close okay let me just post this comment here and then i close okay now at this time i just want to encourage us to go ahead do our video and we upload we shall be sharing some of these uh with the members as we inspire each other because of time i'm going to first proceed to the next item now mr henry henry there yes uh it seems a big percentage of the class yeah has failed to submit to the worker so i want to request you to do a demo well now they will do a video uh do a demo in around 15 minutes don't tell them what they were supposed to do okay then then from there we shall be going to a hands-on we just do a demo then from there which are going to break our session allow me to share yes you are already a co-host so you can share are we there yes are you seeing my screen yes okay so now let's try and uh use our flashback as we had said so first of all you you must have installed it on the computer and i remember giving it a simple video on how to download install and set some of the settings in there so what you're going to do now is to use it and it is on our computer desktop it is just down here flashback express so you're going to double click on it just like that to open and give it time to load so you give it some time to load uh there it has loaded our if uh our our flashback express5 is telling us how we can restore this uh let's discard the others that we are still doing we close that then it opens as a nearly one so it will open just like that and remember we say that uh when you make a video it will actually appear in the recordings here for example i have one of the videos i recorded let's say it was position and it is here so if when i want to access that video i can always come to the recordings so it is always in the corner at the beginning here then at times you might need uh to set some timings for the videos that you have so you click on that then it can allow you to set some timings for your for your videos but some of these things are not needed actually so what you have to do is to know what you're going to record for example the area i want to record the entire screen so i'll need to select the full screen if you want to select some of the regions you say region if you want to select some of the windows only you'll select window but for my case i'm going to select the full screen and it is now selected and don't forget to click on this option of the microphone because when you don't put the microphone you launch what you're going to be presenting and if i told you wanted to add a webcam such as someone can see your presentation as you're doing the presentation as the picture you can as well click on that option then we can go to some of the settings just here we talk about a few of them for example the window if at all you're going to start recording you can say i'll minimize it winner when it is starting to record and two options are available for you for example floating back it can put a timer down here to let you see the minutes that you have used and if you say it is going to be in a trade down or icon tray it will come down on the options down here whenever you want to access it it will be on the icons tray so you can choose any that you feel you want to use and for the sound i think others are already said the way we have seen the other side the microphone is already checked then you can also check on uh the hot keys at times people want to use the shortcuts to start recording for example i want to start recording using the f2 so whenever i press my f2 even if this thing is minimized it will also start recording for example you want to stop the recording you can use f3 when you want to again to pause it you can also use the function five that means that you can specify the shortcuts that you want to use for your for your flashback express before you even begin to record the the what the presentation that you have you can leave it as that others are you can even leave them they are not all that vital they are automatically said so you can just modify a little what you want so we can even come and say okay just like that so now we are going to start recording if i click down here or if i minimize it it will go down that means that i can use the shortcut as we say that we had the shortcut for for record for starting to record which is function what function two so whenever i press the f2 it will start the recording and it will show you that i'm i'm recording you so now we can come and try that and see so let's close this and minimize this one it will go down so i want to start making a presentation on my screen just like that so what i'll do i'll press my function for on sorry function two on my keyboard that i'm having here then i'll press that it will start the recording or if that option doesn't work for you you can as well look at it here click on it and you say start what so now it has already started what recording you see this one it has started recording we can't even decide to do what to stop it so having done that you can as well come and say i'm going to start the presentation i come let's say i need a certain software i'm going to use let's say i can use this one just excel like that i can write some information there for example i want i have some names of my students here this i can have be having some uh subjects there let's say two of them or three let's say chemistry which i can also have by you i can't get that okay just like that doing everything just in a shot so having done everything that you want to present to your students you can as well save the information that you want then you have to stop the what the recording so you'll come and save remember we had the shortcuts which the one was uh the one was for function three or you can even look for it down here and click on that flashback then select the option for stop recall stop recording so you can select any that you feel you want so let me click let me click on it and see actually it had not started recording but we can now start it for example if we stop this and come here we say click on flashback then we can start the recording now so whichever thing that you're going to be doing after that that flashback starts it will be recorded into the other video so i can come and start my uh information let's i'm going to  let's say type anything here you know what you give it time to load you can start typing anything that you feel like let's say i can use the function to get some dynamics here because ara a-n-d i open the bracket i can put some values there let's say four comma five i close the bracket then i say enter so i get some damage here and for example if i want to put uh the heading i can come and say let's say introduction pleasure to ict so i can make some modifications i put this one in the center like i click here i can increase the size i can make it bold i can change the the font style i can even change the color then i have my work as that so this is the workout it's like like the work i've been actually in made over presenting to my students so i can't even decide to save it onto my desktop by coming to the office button you say save so having got data option we come and select desktop then we can write let's say the file name we can leave it as that and we say we say so that is what we wanted to exactly present to our students now we have to stop our our flashback we have to stop our flashback then we have to use the shortcut or you come down here and look for the flashback then you come and do the the scoping of the what of the video so i can click stop then it will show me that it is stopping so the option it gives me here is that you have made a recording and what are you going to do for that recording so you can play the recording you can save the recording you can delete the recording those are the three options we have there so for my case i want to save the recording because i might let's say click on the delete option accidentally and the video goes away so i have to first of all save it because i can play it with it whenever i fail i want so i'll come and click on save so it has to provide me the certain location where i'm going to save data video for example here it is telling me that i'm in my documents and under flashback movies so you can select any location that you feel you want for example you can come to my computer i can come to where i always put my uh my videos i'd say or double click and open i come to my tutorials so my followers are already saved here whenever i make them so i can come and click here so where am i going to save it just here under the ffb settings i can open it then i say i give it a name they say i can call it let's say introduction to ict so i'm going to save it as introduction to ict then i'll say save so my video has been saved so we want to see whether it is already there we come back to our recordings so when you look here it is already here introduction to ict but remember the format it is having cannot be put in other softwares for example for editing so we have to first of all export it to a certain format for example mp4 or other formats so you will come back and click on export so when you click on export it will allow you to export it to a format that you want and then it will ask you which format do you want to save this uh video in i have mp4 i have avi i have windows media video but some of so in most cases mp4 is uh accessible by old some of the phones and other video players so we can choose the mp4 so you come and say okay so it will ask you export of course it's fine i want to export to which location now you choose the location where you want to put that video let's say for uploading to internet now i can choose another location for example i'll come to my computer again where i save my document my videos i'll come to my tutorials again as i said earlier i'll open it then i will come and save it to be uploaded that means that whenever i make a video to be uploaded i have to put it under the uploaded folder so i'll open this and i give it a name introduction to ict so i can say okay save so it will actually start exporting it to my format that i actually opened up that i chose for example mp4 such that it can be accessible we are going to see how it plays actually so you give it some time that's why you're seeing this progress but down here it is showing you that it is moving and whenever the video is too long it will take much time to export that means that you have to make videos when they are specifically shorter such that they can export easily and for uploading them they will always be easy to upload so it is actually now done so we can open the the file where it is located in the location so you click on this one it will take you where that video has been saved and that they uploaded what to be uploaded folder so it is here we can start playing it and we see how it does it so we double click on it it will start playing the other video so i can come and so do you hear what it's saying information list i'm going to  let's say type anything here in what you give it time to load you can start typing anything that you feel like let's say i can use a function to get some dynamics here equals arrow a-n-d i open the bracket i can put some values there let's say four comma five i close the bracket and for example if i want to put uh the heading i can come and say let's say introduction okay uh henry yes please uh yeah thank you very much for for now thank you for the demo uh for now yeah increase the size i can change okay now members i have been making the i have been making the the teachers who have done their assignment to be co-hosts they are going to help us in the break-away sessions i've been looking at the names which are here those who have done their assignment and uh i've made them co-hosts so i've been looking at some videos some of the videos managed it a lot uh others use the phones others use the others using the laptop we have been seeing your videos there so right now we are going to go to breakaway stations and we are going to do these videos in small groups the excellent students who have already done the assignment are going to help the rest of us who are still having issues and um we are going to be uh getting these the students i'm going to be assigning the uh each group with an excellent student so that those of you who are having many questions they are followed at that level when we come back we are going to be hearing from teacher child soto who is going to be giving us some more tips on making our videos well labeled we shall be coming for that immediately after the breakaway sessions the questions and answers will come at the end but we are going first to have them in the breakaway stations and i have a lot of co-hosts here who are going to head past i can say also winnie when he also did the assignment winning end winning end let me hope it is winning and i've also made you a co-host so that you can hit it uh we can hit each other okay so somewhere somewhere what one king okay so for me i will be looking at the google classroom to see the good students and uh we shall be helping each other accordingly okay so what you do we are going to go to uh breakout stations i'm opening them in a few minutes yes yes okay so we are going to have you're going to have radius let's have four yes mr bukuti isaac has a hand up i wonder maybe other assumptions will come after the breakthrough sessions we are going to answer those questions in small groups but you can be speaking as i assign the breakouts mr isaac you can go ahead when you reach the group you can use you can use the n you can use a phone one of you should have a computer you share a screen then you do what henry has done as other friends give input so at the end of the session we shall come back and share with us what you have managed to do you can share with your phone or you can share with the laptop any of you in the group who can be able to take on that role yes when you come back we also have to look at the qualities of a good video i think hey we shall we shall have that at the end as one of the last options actually mr two is going to be hinting on that okay so what you do members uh storages yes um i beg for instructions again because i didn't hear the instructions are one of you in the group who is on a computer can share a screen or if you have your phone you already have a screen recorder app you share a screen then you discuss how you can record a small you just have to show to discuss how do you record a video and you you do it practically as the way henry has been doing it when we are seeing one of you should do it another thing and giving input so by the time we finish you should come back when you have made some video even if it is one minute that's what you are going to be doing  okay so um  yeah i think let me open the groups when you reach there you should be able to have a leader and you should be able to do some great work there how long 20 minutes 15 minutes not 20 15. okay you hmm  okay members uh welcome back welcome back we'll come back thank you welcome back for the sessions i've been moving around you see with the zoom you can make a group discussions and the u.s teacher you can move around it is a really interesting experience if you have never done things you should do uh practice on it uh very soon okay so i've been moving around and i've seen another members have managed to do the videos i'm going to be inviting members to uh show you that's what they have done in room in room number one mr bukut isaac please tell us what you have managed to do have you created the video which screening recorder have you used isaac okay isaac are you there um mr rogers yes yes um i wish to apologize we had some challenges um i do when i joined the afternoon session i joined not with the my laptop i don't using my phone so by the time i got back to the phone and trying to connect it was a little bit giving me some challenges so we couldn't finish that so what have you been doing in the group we have just been chatting not chatting um at first we tried i tried to share what i had done with the work that i submitted and the when we tried when i tried connecting to my laptop that's where the challenge was and also when we tried to get a member to share the member could not share her screen because she had a screen recorder okay thank you mr apologize to the members one no room two yes mr lodges what have you done in room two we have tried to discuss about uh i have used the obs software and then simple video okay let me try to first locate my file okay let me show you now i'm going to share okay yes yes okay so this is what we are trying to to create okay so i'm clearing okay  you just minimize this you click in the middle so you minimize the focus you minimize it is it okay yes then you go and launch maybe obviously thank you very much on your icon for office word it will open okay then click on blank document okay there we go okay so you can start typing maybe computer lesson okay okay michael yes we don't have much time so i'm giving only two minutes to a group then we are going to have the final in group in general as a group room number three mr willie whackaby what have you been doing in room number three oh mr chair uni uh what we have done henry they come henry the computer guy was sharing with us uh how to make the complex if a video you have made a video that is of a large volume it required through how complex it say that it may be the news say that it's so easy i have used the flashback on the bricks and from in the flashback he went to the handy brick handbrake um uh hungry i hope you never dominated the group again that's the chance but no are you again okay let me go to group number four rule number four room number four mr charles uh mr charles  oh thank you thank you uh in group number four i wanted to find out if they had created a video but uh they were telling me that they did not i use powerpoint share screen and i see yeah i've recorded it but i can't see it i don't know where it has gone but i recorded some small videos uh on this particular topic that i've made this one here let me show you i did some recording on these i showed them and they really recorded very well so they proceed okay let me first share my screen okay all right okay can you see my screen now yes we can see yeah so i was able to show them that you go to recording then you go to video new recording after you go to recording then you go to video goes free recording then it will show you to select the area that you want to select so for me i always go with the full screen like that then you go back to your presentation you open the slideshow mode and then you go and then you record you you just start recording it from here like you can you can really see that it is showing you that it is recording in progress so we just do this so this is what i was saying when you are done you just come here and then you stop the recording you see that the recording is already here okay okay okay thank you very much mr chelsea i've used the powerpoint members powerpoint also can record you don't even believe that you don't download anything else let oh thank you so much mr rodriguez now for me i took my colleagues through using a phone to record and with a phone i used a screen recorder which is found just up here where we control from other features like internet and then the rest so are you able to share a screen on your phone yes let me reach there let me share we managed to make a small video i think you can see my screen now and the video is just here this is what we have recorded during that time of break okay members sometimes i realize when you start recording the microphone because the the sound goes down because the screen recorder is using the microphone and zooms so sometimes but i you can see he has shared this and he's able to display his powerpoint and he can go to landscape mode and still uh show the screen when it is big i don't know whether this is what i presented and took them through how the ammunitions gave me the next action as you can see so i told them i keep pressing the volume button and the one i used to reduce then it would give me that action okay are you able to go through are you able to rotate your phone so that the slide becomes big yes i'm able you try and listen okay okay is it okay yes is it okay there yes it's okay all right but i think the video is now over unless i restart it is over okay thank you very much uh mr joel uh for that sharing now members like i said these sessions are for inspiring you and telling you which tool to use the practice is on your on your side don't expect to come to this session and you learn all those programs but you need to know that powerpoint can do it so when you go to your computer go to powerpoint click on recordings try computer is launched by trying not by lecturing so when you come here be inspired know what to use practice when we give the assignment do at the end of the two weeks there will be a difference so i remember that is our session uh mr charles mr soto yes please uh there is something that you wanted to tell us about to is it quizzes is it what oh let me just hurry up very very fast okay yes good evening members i hope people are now died so i'm just going to take you through there's only two things one is making quizzes using um powerpoint and then two are putting annotation on your on your videos within just seven minutes it should be done so let me share my screen um okay i hope member can see my screen remember can you see my screen now yes okay so i first wanted to check on these this particular meta presentation here  okay so let me open it so yesterday i made some presentation here um like making it is now easy that just posts likes and if you see some flights are having quizzes here that understand too so uh i use what they call an application that is called ice screen shoots it's very very powerful if you want i can give you a link where you can go and download it why this tool is special is because it embeds itself onto powerpoint so the moment you download that application you can see that the icon will come here right away after hello on microsoft powerpoint so you can use this for making your quizzes so now on this presentation that i made if i can go to ice cream if you click on the ice cream there are tools here like quiz you can see quiz here interaction and youtube you can even link to youtube direct templates there are also characters and background and so forth you go and find out from there so when you make your slide here you can go to publish or preview you can preview your slide from a browser yeah like from from the current slide or the entire presentation i can click on the entire presentation then i just move myself it will take some time i'm just reviewing it i'm not yet like publishing it so there are four slides so i want you to see how it will play how this particular presentation will play okay it's just taking some time but it will come on so uh yeah they are now dance like four four this one can help you build your lesson in the real classroom because you can teach a topic then you can ask learners to answer some questions so it does come you can review it how it will appear on mobile phone tablets and then so forth you can see that the display is there you can make it also bigger this particular presentation bigger from here so uh and you make it you extend it there so if i start playing my presentation you see it will go just like this one and you continue that this is what i made during my presentation and also i've leveled this diagram very well yes and now after i will ask you that now it is time for quizzes
you're going to answer this question this one can help you in your lesson so i will ask them questions like what i say is in that occupy space and ask so i told one student to come and answer the question now they can say as way so when they click on wait you see it is interactive they submit their question their answer yes that is you choose a correct response one just like that continue on to this one you answer you continue yes then you continue like that so you can even add you can make mathematic questions you add and then learners can come and eat right away and a powerpoint and if you can give you few results so you can see that congratulations you have passed you scored three out of three you see so that is what these people call ice cream can do it it's a very very powerful tool now the last one is about making uh uh editing your videos like my brother recorded a video from the phone i like it so if you want to learn how to make business using ice cream like utilities say it is just a software we are directing you there so that you know what you can do with them we are not here to teach you time may not be there but you can consult so let's go back to um recording this is i screenshots i can go to screen recording again if the user has its own screen recording you can see you can record you can do everything that you want so i'll go to new recording now it has given me the area that i should select there are many things here if i say record it will start recording it's saying that you press f10 if you're down so it's still recording i can just press f10 now immediately you see add annotation to the square recording the option will come there add annotation so you may decide to add an annotation these are the the the the words that you write into your videos explanation that you have seen you can say okay then you continue now this is my video that it has recorded but i may not be interested in this video i just want to get a video from outside the one that i've recorded using my phone so you can come still and get another video um you can embed a video here this this is called a timeline this is a timeline this is for audio and this is for video you can import another video you can click on a video then you go to a desktop there is a video that i recorded using my phone you can see here so when i open it i bring it to on to that particular the video editor here so if i play this video you can really see you can really see that it's moving this video has got no sound so how do you bring now the annotation it's not simple this is another video that i recorded i can delete it then i want to bring annotations somewhere just onto the timeline so what you do it comes with this tool if you click on home you see there are shapes like the one apartment you can bring audio you can get another video then a text will come and also share it so me i always take the shapes then i go with any you can think this the rectangle you draw it here anything you want you can  so you can export your project so if i say a spot you can export it like that if i say publish it will give me option to publish it in my computer when i'm done with editing you can really see here even on youtube you can do so so rogers allow me to stop here thank you so much for listening i really wish you guys for the best more information you can contact me and i explain it to you okay uh thank you very much uh chels uh members mr charles there has the uh a youtube channel called teacher charles tv it is a a complete tv and it has um  it has some very good tutorials even there is one which i was sharing in there what's up group there where he had a video what he has been doing there about to  using the what using that tool to to do those kinds of videos so please you go to teacher charles tv and uh you can be able to watch uh also henry the computer guy made a video about the the what we shared if you have nothing if you have not he understood maybe was very fast there is a bigger video that he has created there on using handbrake so you just go to utilize the resources that are being available the materials which are being available there's a video here about how to download and install flashback this one shows you right from downloading so you don't have an excuse to say that they were very fast because the materials are there for you which you can play and repeat and repeat and repeat then there's also something about to he was talking about quizzes we're talking about zoom zoom also has some apps apps are used to extend the capability of zoom when you go into zoom you'll see for example there's this one called kahoot it is used for quizzes during a zoom session once you add it in your zoom it can add quizzes so there are very many apps here and others which you can use and they enhance your experience so just search for zoom apps and you can be able to install them so uh we are going to get uh some i'm seeing kassadin's hand is up we are concluding within maximum five minutes i'm just getting comments from a few members the full recording for this session is going to be is going to be provided uh good friend um i think katherine what's up about  she told me that she used the wps to record on ford and also um there is someone who asked for us our session we used the phone recording and we used the interview so someone was asking how do we how do we record they should download if you don't have that option in your phone because it needs a better phone a better smartphone not all smartphones have that okay thank you mr chavez movie room videos hello because of the quality of my phone but i have a laptop i was how can i connect and then i was also asking when if during this session those are my concerns okay thank you very much so mr and actually with a laptop you'll see a bigger picture than the phone you installed on the computer i search for zoom and install for windows and then you can be able to log in with it like for me i'm having both my phone and my laptop in so i can if one jumps off one will can at least i can remain on and i can you can also zoom on on zoom it allows you to to enlarge the image using your two fingers i don't know whether that was the question but you were there was an echo so we were not hearing well mr charles yes michael there were two people talking so anna anatoly was talking as well as movie so let us give movie worlds a chance movie though okay meanwhile registration form has been sent to the church i don't know if there is any communication any communication from any any argument but tomorrow we shall be looking at collaboration you're going to be looking at things of google drive and other ways of collaborating so let us be there and uh we share more we are going to share some more resources we are going to research and get some more resources including handouts which are written because some members want to read and also more tutorials on some of the concepts if you have anything it's a problem raise it in whatsapp groups and we shall be ready to respond and give support  i want to thank you very much for this meeting i don't know if there's any any admin who has anything to say but uh we should be closing now mr yusuf rogers yes what i you speak briefly one minute i want to thank you very much i have two questions one i see this as an association of iet teachers how can you join it as a full member and then another thing is that if possible you can share with us some of those downloaders those links for those software are they payable free or what because some like zoom you have to pay to be safe those who are unfair are not table like i've liked the ice spring suit 10 how is it is it payable for or you can download it for free okay thank you very much first of all this is the i i don't know that you missed the orientation and the idea of orientation hey that's why that's why you're asking that question this is a training for teachers and uh it is organized by edify uganda and uh sponsored by edifier and also coordinated by the christian school owners association and uh you tell all the ict association we are just trainers and people who are who are supporting this program from the tech training site but uh we have a number of stakeholders and we have school directors school owners different schools uh initiative of christian schools so that we upskill ourselves and be the guitar teachers so it's not an association it's a program uh in that kind of arrangement yeah so you go to our google classroom the presentation which you use before orientation is there you can be able to do more and also get the schedule uh mr charles so talk you talked about the spring and they're asking you whether it is i think chelsea's off yeah we shall research more about the ice spring and we see whether it is free but at the other screen record as we're recommending we're free ones zoom is the having a free version which is limited uh so if you have to access some of the features you may need to subscribe yeah so rogers yes he wanted if he wants to join italy i had an association in tow that's what he wanted to know he was mistaking the training to be an association you got the website each of the organizations has a website you got the website it's how you can register on the inside of it if you want if you are an ict teacher christian school owners christians also you can join uh the contacts are on the on the website uh for edify we have the hh integration officer for 85 mr dennis maybe you can give us a final word and we close mr dennis thank you rogers good evening everyone sorry today it has taken a little bit longer but i hope you have uh taken understood something and can be able to go and apply it in your in your next adventure of online classes what we advise is that after after getting this knowledge these skills please go and practice and go and try out now you know that you can actually conduct lessons without the necessarily have needing a computer you just need data and a smartphone and you will be able and zoom or or a platform so just go and try out if you try out and let me tell you parents are desperate if you if you attend our online classes you see how many kids we have in every class every day you realize that parents really want their children to learn and so this skill is an added an added value to you please go and make use of it go and exercise try out you can even try to teach a few kids using your phone or using your laptop if it works out edify is here to help you implement in your school we can send the team out to come and help the entire guy the entire teaching staff or you can even train your your fellow teaching staff on how this is done since you've done the training and the learning goes on so let us learn this and go and put in practice we don't know when the schools will be opening and that means this skill is a necessary one all these skills we are learning now it is unnecessary they are all necessary and we should go and put it into practice thank you so much make sure you

created using punon  hello and welcome welc to how to make your school a digital rockar today we're talking about e-learning and security did I get it right well security and all those sorts of things yes suddenly I get very insecure now that we're on in the moment I feel like I don't know enough and of course you are Michael I am Michael hello Helen how are you today I'm good thank you how are you very good that's good and we have heard from you before we know where you come from so I'm not going to ask you to retell us again I think you proved yourself in the last two webinars that you do know what you're talking about so if you don't know where he comes from go and watch the past two webinars and you can see there also pretty good content in those last two I think we've covered a great deal of content yeah yes so they're worth watching if you're not only watching to find out who Michael is that's right I think there's more important reasons to watch than finding out who I am very definitely and of course we have Dylan behind the buttons and he'll be watching the Twitter feed remember that #v webinars that's via Africa webinars if you want to talk to us or you can scroll down from this window and you'll see just below there's a little chat box you enter in a login name and Dylan will be watching there as well for any comments and feedback as well as if you want to make comments on the Via Africa Facebook page be watching there great okay so we're talking about security but before we get onto that last week we spoke about uh the infrastructure behind e-learning that's one of the questions yeah people asked yes and you said you would come back to us with a checklist and you have not disappointed thank you so we're going to look at it now it's up on screen okay um and it's beautifully set out thank you Gus did it so thanks for that the office I think one of the things that we found is in terms of it being a checklist it's pretty difficult because everybody's situation is different and if you have a pure checklist you could quite easily exclude yourself and so whoops I can't do this because I don't meet criteria one and two so what we've tried to do is we've tried to consider three options whether you're working on a very limited budget or a modest or limited budget and then an unlimited budget and we've divided into three sections what Hardware you could afford and what software you can use and what your internet connectivity is and I think schools will be able to get a good sense just based upon that where they find themselves and then as you scroll down we've taken each of those components we've looked very carefully at the specs or specifications that they should be considering and then particularly I think as important as the column what to use it for it's all very well to say oh you need to go off and get a 3G router type thing but what are you going to use it for or if you're going to get a tablet why would you use a tablet versus using a desktop or a laptop sure so it's e uh it's ICT for dummies almost what how what do I choose and then how do I use it that's it yeah what to use it for and the webinars about how you use these things yes oh that's fantastic it's quite long so it's going through long it's very I think it's well worth going through people can find it on our website they're going to have a look and we've provided a version where they'll be able to print it so that it doesn't try and squeeze all these pages into one tiny little PDF and then you can't read it at all that's yeah so they can find the printable version or they can Scroll online like we are okay well I'll let people go through that in their own time we're not going to read through each point so let's go on to what's up for today mhm and here it is is there really a threat now this is in terms of security that's it taking care of Learners taking care of hardware and software and taking care of data that's the agenda yes it is but we're not going to start talking are we no I think when we were chatting I thought a really good idea would be for us to go into a sense of of what is this threat and is there a threat and you found us a really good video that I think will give people a good sense of where we're going in today's talk and this video as well as all of the other videos that we do show on the webinar are available on YouTube so you will be able to find them there and let's go to it and I think this one was developed okay BL play oh  man compound a 46.7% by weight compound B  once you post your image online you can't take it back anyone can see it family friends anyone remember think before you post  that video was created as a public service announcement I think somewhere in the states and I can't find the original copy but I think it really brings across the point of how a simple posting can become so much more that's it and I think you know we so comfortable well particularly young people are so comfortable online we very quickly forget that in that safe space that we working is may not be as safe as we think yes and whereas previously you know you wrote a letter to somebody could be crumpled up and destroyed whereas now it once it's posted it's posted online forever and once you've worked there it's going to be there for a long time and it's not just pictures that can be redistributed it can be political views that you have or uh okay so hopefully this never happens to Learners because they wouldn't be drinking but some kind of drunken message that they typed and then it's just reposted or retweeted over and over that's it U for example that American Woman who was coming to South Africa and then tweeted that it's some terrible tweet by the time she landed in South Africa she'd lost her job and that's the end of it yeah she wasn't greeted with happy faces at the airport but I think one of the key things is that whenever we see these sort of public service announcements there's a lot about it seems always to be what's happening in America what's happening in in Europe and I found some interesting statistics about South Africa that I think might make the seem a little more real well let's go on to them just click next and there we go I mean this is from January 2014 so things have only increased and population of about 48.6 million and we got 20 million internet users which is 41% now when I saw that I was quite startled cuz I kept thinking oh but we don't have Broadband but we forget that if you look at the bottom there are 68.4 million sell phone users and more and more cell phones have the ability to be online so it makes that 20 million very very easy so in terms of averages I mean if you factor children into that 48.6 million and assuming that young children wouldn't have cell phones it means that every adult could very easily have two phones and be working on both that's it but more and more young people do have cell phones and I think the whole policy where where people have a contract and you're able to keep your handsets and get a new handset and upgrade every two years means that more and more cell phones are actually trickling down to younger and younger people yes oh yes so and I mean just in terms of what we're talking about Facebook 9.8 million South Africans on Facebook actively okay so that's 20% yeah so the use of social media is with us and it's growing so what we're talking about today a lot of the statistics we're going to have to be using overseas statistics stcs because they're more easily available and we haven't started making those statistical analyses for us but I think as we look at them people need to Bear these figures in mind because I think they come back to talk to us yes well let's take a look at those statistics you're talking about okay and I did get a fright when I looked at these cuz I thought I have a six-year-old and she's not on the internet okay there have been a few times where I've Googled something with her but other than that she's not on it okay so where are these statistics from these are British statistics and again another Public Service Announcement being put out and I mean five Age 5 to7 82% of kids online probably not nearly anything like that in South Africa but when you're looking at the age 12 to 15 almost every single child in the UK online and I think we're going to move there yes sooner than we think and the Curious thing is is that in terms of the government wanting to make make available that um ICT infrastructure for schools it means that automatically every single one of our 12 million odd Learners is going to be online yes so we'll have 100% technically between age 6 and age 18 I wonder how many discussions they have about what they're doing online and discussions with younger people and discussions with older I wonder if it is a point of discussion or do you only discuss things that you're doing online with people that you're online with but I think we come to that later about that yes um we're going to be talking little later about the consequences of this but 28% of children between 11 and 16 have um experienced something upsetting in the last year on social networks and you know we always want to keep children safe and happy but a third of them are being made unhappy by the very thing that's supposed to create connected connectedness and wellbeing more scary perhaps um for you as a mother of a child that one in three of the people who are online haven't actually met which means that they're talking to complete strangers and screens rather than human beings that they know so you know we talk about um stranger danger and don't talk to strangers and yet when it seems to be a photograph of somebody your age Etc you're going to go on time oh yes we've chatted a lot about time and whether or not there should be that much screen time for young people and I mean looking at Age 3 to 7 6 and 1 half hours a week online let alone watching television I think is scary it's almost an hour a day that's it yeah and then just the last one I wanted to talk about now is just looking at the number of kids who own a digital device which could either be a phone or a tablet or computer and the number of items there are significant pleased to see that it's only only 41% in age three and four but 95% by 12 to 15 I see some of my friends doing this though they have a toddler and suddenly the toddler has an iPad I don't have an iPad why does a 2 three-year-old need an iPad I don't know but um I think I think there's some really fabulous things that a three-year-old could be doing on an iPad I'm not sure if they need their own personal iPad in which to do it yes that's more the point for me yeah I want an iPad if someone buys me one I'll be very happy okay and this statistic over here 41% of parents believe their children know more about internet than they do uh that's that's very curious that one you know the majority of teachers are parents in our country now that statistic for the UK 41% believe the kids know more than they do I would say it's pretty fair to say it's representative in South Africa now as teachers we there to guide and Lead our Learners and if there's a perception that the Learners know more about it one of two things can happen either you can refuse to use it because you don't want to be shown up or you can give the Reigns over to them and be led by them and they may well not be able to lead as securely and safely as we want to do so I think it's something we need to keep in the back of our minds as we talk throughout the rest of the afternoon yes I think so okay moving on to more statistics do you know what your children are doing online okay well 75% of parents don't monit to their children's online activity each day now when I came across these statistics I thought oh well goodness gracious do you expect me as a parent to on to manage my children's online activity every single day but when we start talking about the things that we are you start to think well surely you know you ask how was your day did you do your homework yes why aren't you asking what were you doing online what did you do what did you learn what did you see and I think also monitoring your children's online activity doesn't necessarily mean that you have to ask them questions it could just mean that they only use the computer in a public area where you can constantly walk past and monitor it without asking questions that's it looks a bit better when we go weekly 64% of parents under 35 are checking weekly and 40% of parents over 45 now what struck me there automatically is that it seems that younger parents are more in tune with some of the dangers perhaps or more in tune with the technology now bringing that back to South Africa the majority of our teachers are over 45 which puts them into that parental age group so what wonders how teachers are feeling in terms of monitoring their Learners where they have online Learners in their classrooms how they feel about it and what they're doing in terms of monitoring yeah and then 15% never check that's it which means that at least 15% of children are at risk if they haven't been well educated in terms of what they should do when they're working on social media when they're going online I can hear some of my friends voices in my head saying but yeah they my child I should trust them and um they must do what's right and I must just believe that they're going to do that without getting into any moral sort of things I think yes we need to trust our children but we're not necessarily able to trust everybody out there yes and in South Africa as I said we got another 19,99 198 whatever thousand people out there I mean and that just excludes the that's only if they manage to be stuck in the South African um online which actually it's International and there's billions of people online well you know if these parents were sending their 15-year-old to a birthday party they would want to know whose house is at who else is going to be attending so same rules should apply that's it yes this graphic was quite interesting for me particularly not just the fact that 48% of parents believe their teens tell them everything they do online it's goes back to those 15y old at parties you were just talking about all that 71% of teens have hidden their online behavior from their parents but the fact actually that it's infographic produced by maffy a well-known antivirus supplier yes and there's a lot of people doing a lot of things to make sure that everybody's safe online and I think before we make people out there start thinking oh heavens we better turn off the webinar before we get infected by some sort of evil that's going to come off the internet we need to say that actually it's not all doom and gloom and not all bad yes and I think we need to look at it in a more holistic way and that's what I hope we can do I agree with you there you can't just uh say no to everything because one thing scares you that's it okay so the next point we're going to talk about is a hugely loaded issue and that is cyber bullying okay it's what is what is cyber bullying well in the basic definition it's bullying via electronic means you know when we were growing up and we didn't have cell phones and tablets Etc the bullies used to grab you and beat you with the gate or they used to demand lunch money or lunch from you or they used to tease you or make fun of you and those were all very inyou face activities the problem now is that with connectivity it's possible that the those same bullies are able to do the same thing except they can do it using their cell phones they can use it use their tablets computers they use the communication methods email Facebook Etc and so what starts to happen is you get the same physical bullying taking place except in electronic form and perhaps that might be an even more dangerous way because it's not as public as one would see a normal bully physically bullying somebody or maybe not as obvious because technically it's in the public domain in the public domain but when I'm reading the horrible email you sent me on my phone unless I show something else it's it's it's it's my anxiety that I got to carry as a as a as a child in fact as an adult I mean I think we need to be aware that sa Bullying happens for adults as well people are stalked people do get abusive messages and so yeah becoming aware of cyber bullying is quite a key issue now yes just a quick point to to add in there the one of the other differences that I've heard between sort of physical traditional bullying and cyber bullying is is often the step into that bullying behavior is a lot more difficult to make if you have to physically be present and you have to physically see the person that you're bullying it's a lot easier it's a lot more consci conscionable for you to bully somebody through technology um rather than than physically so a lot more people can can more easily do it that's I mean Eden you were talking about keyboard keyboard courage keyboard courage I think keyboard courage is absolutely amazing concept because it's very easy to hide behind a screen and tap on a keyboard and send out these messages that as dlan says to go face to face with somebody can be a completely different thing yeah and these are children at the end of the day and if it's happening I mean it would be nothing for me to get a horrible email and to then pick up the phone and confront the person and say listen what's going on why are you doing this or I say it would be nothing but let's see when it actually happens but it's a lot more difficult if you're eight or nine that's and you've received some kind of threatening SMS and you feel isolated and alone it's not nice no no and it's more prevalent than we think yes which is the next question how prevalent is it okay well I mean we were in the previous slides we've spoken about 28% of um children have experienced some sort of upsetting thing during social media and the statistics that I found are that 16% in a survey last year done in the United Kingdom 16% of children had experienced cyber bullying in some form or other and that's seems small but 16% is a good chunk of the of the young people who are online yes and what we forget is with a statistic like that it's okay it's 16 out of 100 so yeah but there also a friends and that cyber bullying does affect the friends because who will a child turn to or I know from a girl's point of view age 11 something like that happened I would have told all of my friends I'm sure then it turns into a vicious cycle cuz bullying and then you fight back with your friends and that's it messy messy very much deed but of course if 60% of Learners say that they've bullied been bullied online one has to ask the question is who's doing the bullying and in the same survey 9% of Learners admitted to engaging in cyber bullying now the survey that was done was an anonymous survey so hopefully all the bullies spoke out but that 10% of of kids had engaged in it means that it's quite an easy thing to do one I mean we sitting in a class got 38 or 40 children that means four of those children are committing cyber bullying yes I wonder if they even know that that's what they're doing well I think that's that's quite a key question because you know it's very easy to to call you a name to your face but if I send something as as apparently as um insubstantial as an email you know it's just a few little keystrokes and then off it goes do they know that that is Cy bullying one question and also I mean sometimes just sending a friend request on Facebook for example and the person ignores you and sending again and again and again and again that turns into a form of bullying yeah like intimidation type very much so and it's hard to quantify that so I think it's possible that some cyber bullies don't really know that it is that they what they're doing but I mean one starts to think well ultimately if it's if you can think of it as a physical act rather than just an online act and they're the same well then ultimately you should know what you're doing I think when you're talking about it with children if someone has posted an unfair comment or something like that maybe asking them would you write that on a piece of paper and stick it on the person physically that's it would you be able to walk up to them look them in the eyes and do that that's it yeah me there's a couple of lovely questions I came across around that and children should be taught when they're posting would a would they say it publicly in in a public forum B is that something they want to be remembered for yes and if if if they just keep those two questions in mind I think it could help a whole lot I think also we talk a lot about cyber bullying as if someone's already on a social network but another form is taking photos of someone and then posting them wherever whether it's sending it off on a or it's um posting it on a public forum that's it it's still cyber bullying because it's using technology and I mean we've seen that quite a bit in South Africa we've had those horrible videos either of children um engaging in sexual practices or even children fighting that suddenly go viral because get send from one cell phone to another so the the original participants weren't involved but suddenly everything about them is public yeah yes horrible horrible horrible okay now the next step then seeing as we've started talking about the sexual aspect which is usually a taboo Topic in the studio we need to talk about taking care of Learners in terms of exposure to adults unwanted adult attention right I think we were been quite strategic when we put this order of things together today because usually we would start here because I think the the fear of adult predators and children is the first thing that comes to mind when people think about the security of Learners and I think our wanting to foreground that Learners themselves are engaging in this sort of negative behavior was quite important but it doesn't mean that there are adults who would want to find out things about Learners become involved with Learners in ways that we do not want them to be yes and it's something that we can only train young people to be aware of just as we train them don't talk to a stranger we need to start inculcating the same levels in terms of what do you do when I'm online Etc it's almost the same set of rules that would apply in everyday life that you'd apply online that's it and it's it's Common Sense rules and I'm not exactly sure why online has made us lose some of our Common Sense yes but it seems to be so yeah so some very basic rules I think number one is to set up some ground rules well there we go that's it you know what what are what when may you use your device where may you go online what sort of things and it's not about just setting those rules but it's about negotiating the terms of those rules with the children so that they get to understand exactly what it's about that it's not just as children so often want to believe oh Mom and Dad are being spiteful to me you know they to get me they don't want me to have friends but it's about discussing that in ways that make sense to them at the time it's almost like teaching them how to navigate The Pantry you're not going to you say listen that bottom shelf is mommy and daddy's only cuz that's where the alcohol is okay maybe it's a top shelf about the structure of your that's not not a good example okay please refer to rule four on the slide and then the sweets that's for occasional use but only over under supervision uh but there's a fruit bowl over there that you're welcome to if you're going to use the eggs make sure that you cook them first it's a set of procedures that's it everything's available but you can't have everything that's right yeah because so much can be but in terms of of that availability what it is possible to do is to set parental control on devices now Apple devices are quite easy because they have built-in parental controls that you can set Android devices a little more complex because you have to download software okay but there is a number of places that are offering free software that parents are able to set that control so it prevents the child being able to go to certain websites it prevents social media etc etc so software even tracks their movements what they spend more time doing so you can choose what you want that's it in your software yes can we get some suggested examples of those perhaps for the blog post that's a fantastic C I mean one of the most popular one is K9 as in K9 and that's very very effective in terms of it but yeah we let's add some in I think yeah good places to go and this kind of list is always evolving cuz technology there's always something bigger and better coming out so maybe if someone out there has one that they use send it through that's it let Dylan know he'll make a list thank you dyl number three says educate yourself and your children about the internet and safety that's it I mean going back to ear where that number of parents believe their children know more about the internet than they do we're adults we can learn quickly and effectively and I think we need to put ourselves in that position I mean I think it was the second webinar the first we spoke about the difference between a digital native and a digital immigrant and yes we may as adults all be the digital immigrants but we can actually become a little more naturalized to the world that we're working in now yes yes uh and then the fourth one says set a good example so don't put the alcohol on the bottom shelf possibly not but I think it's also I mean for me there it's quite tricky because obviously your children wouldn't always be exposed to whatever it is that you're doing online but the point is here good examples are screen time yes um use of devices at dinner tables and and things like that and for for children to start to see that the technology has a place in the world and it's a very powerful place but it doesn't have to dominate everything and I think that's where parents have the opportunity to set a really good example yes still sorry just a quick question on that point and perhaps just to extend it as well um question through on on the on the IRC feed is is what should schools be doing if they become aware of this kind of predatory behavior or even cyber bullying and what kind of example should schools be it be setting in this in this area it's it's easy easier to imagine a parent sitting an example yes bring that to the school context okay well that's actually the next slide so I wonder if you could hang in there with us and we'll be able to do it well yes it is what schools can do education not prohibition okay I think that's a key one for me the internet and social media provide a remarkable possibility for Learning and we need to not fall into the Trap that it's easier just to say no you can't have anything and rather look towards the education of it yes there are enough places online that you can go to to get good safe material and we need to be helping Learners get to those places we need to be setting up the understanding of our Learners in such ways that they understand why some places are are good in some places are not so good when it comes to the internet and internet usage so Dylan I think to answer the question that you raised I think in many ways schools take on much the same role as the parent and need to play that role because with connectivity coming to schools there's going to be the possibility of all of these things happening and I'd hate to see a situation that we got a broadband connection to every school in South Africa and the children never go online because everybody's just too scared to use it so we need to duplicate it I mean and the second point we make is that they need to set up standard operating procedures for Internet Security now every school has a set of procedures for general safety and General Security that the teachers and the and the Learners comply with and I think it's very much the similar situation we just need to develop those sorts of rules so that when it comes to the internet that they duplicate back to the common sense every day thing you spoke about earlier I'd like to talk more about the education not prohibition because this is something that fects us quite a bit in our working circumstance we've got a lot of educational content on YouTube like K Academy and things like that but what we often find is that educational institutions block YouTube out of fear of seeing something that's inappropriate if people actually put a little bit more thought and effort into finding out about YouTube they'd see that YouTube doesn't really allow inappropriate content on the platform they've got quite as strict measuring guideline uh yes some things do slip through but they're quite difficult to find and there are also ways to get around that if you block YouTube or you block Facebook or you block whatever you're blocking a method to learn and sometimes the learning is not only about the content that's present present there it's also about learning how to manage yourself on that Platform One of a a great skill you need to learn when managing YouTube or going on to YouTube is to not get distracted by cat videos and that's really important it's a really good 21st century skill to learn that's it I mean it's that discernment and you're not going to learn the discernment unless you have the opportunity to to play with it but I mean two things one you could as a school what you can do is you can set the YouTube use to Safe yes and that is a possibility but secondly also if a school register for a Google education account it automatically is going to put Place higher filter levels on the YouTube which is part of Google so that they don't Learners don't easily have access to anything that might slip through because what's once it's in that container as it were it's been very very carefully vetted now going back to the question about uh what you do as a school I'm reminded of when I was studying and we did this um education course with within the education course we were already doing and we spoke about in loco parentis where School becomes the parents while the child is at school so all of the rights that apply to parents and okay I'm not a law person but how I understood it is basically as soon as someone steps into my classroom I am their parent until they leave again so the same things I apply at home to my children I would apply in my classroom if it's not acceptable for my children to behave unacceptably uh on the internet then it won't be acceptable within my classroom as well it is very difficult to manage though when you've got private messages flying around and I do remember one case where this did happen where there was a child who was being stalked by another child in the school and it was horrible eventually there were death threats issued and this child didn't know who this other person was how do you deal with that well luckily the child had enough support that they could find figure out who it was and that person went through a proper disciplinary process and was dealt with um and you have to if you're being threatened whether it be a threat over an email or a threat in real life it has to be dealt with that's it so it comes down to that standard operating procedures for the internet and security that's it and I think making it a discussion document in the first instance I think is quite key because again otherwise it turns into that sort of particularly for teenagers that sort of rebellious thing hi you don't want me to go there so let me see if I can sneak in whilst the teacher's not looking and go to those sites um it needs to be that sort of negotiation so that there's a greater understanding of of what the dangers are yes you almost have to do a bit of psychological maneuvering here where you have to guide them into doing what you want them to do rather than rebelling against what you want them to do yes and I've seen some nice things online in terms of pledges that children can sign say things like Do no harm to others and stuff like that uh would you like to take a look at yeah let a look one would you mind pressing escape on the keyboard do that and then we can go to and this is just the first thing that popped up on Google and it has a whole lot of printable pledges that they can download but what you see is it says I will not I will tell my trusted adult if anything makes
me feel sad scared or confused and that's a really great phrasing for a young child it's obviously a primary school that's it and it's important to have rules like that so that people feel open to talk about what's happening I think it's good what I like particularly about this site is that they've got a set of rules for Internet safety rules and then they got real world safety rules and if you look at them the real world safety rules mirror very much the Internet safety rules which is exactly what we were talking about earlier yes okay but back to our presentation and the topic at hand which is security okay and we're going to move on to taking care of hardware and software that's it I mean I think what we moving towards here is sort of I nearly say the more adult part of the conversation and I think the reason I think of that is just that I always think of of it's the adult responsibility to take care of the technology thank you yes so um although the person who's using the technology would be the first to pick up that something is not right that's it but remember both teacher and learner should be using the technology yes so the first one says well what is a virus okay well viruses I mean everybody seems to know what a virus is when they get it and they wonder about how they got it afterwards it's really just any piece of software coding text that duplicates itself on a machine and is able to take over portions or even a whole computer and do all sorts of damage so viruses are created with very negative intent and they cause a great deal of harm I mean and the number of viruses that get generated yearly are runs into the hundreds of thousands if you visit one of the anti virus software sites like kasperski or maffy you'll be horrified to see exactly how many viruses get set out into the wild every single day yeah so I read somewhere a long time ago and I should have re Googled it to find out but I heard that there's quite a big industry in creating viruses people make a lot of money apparently so it's scary it is I would think the way you would make money is by then selling the anti virus solution to an antivirus software company that's it so you create a problem and then you fix it well you don't want to get into conspiracy [Laughter] theories yes I mean many schools have found that for example going for Apple products where they seem to be fewer viruses are a better solution just because they don't there are fewer threats yes but I mean not every school wants to go that route because automatically it moves them into a different space in terms of the software that's available for example yes that's something to be aware of but antiviral software is really easily available there is really great free stuff available and when you think of the damage that can get done spending some money on it is certainly the way to go that old proverb Pennywise pound foolish is pretty much what kicks into there now what is the difference between getting a virus and being hacked okay hacking is a way of exposing information and getting information so that you're able to find out things now that falls into the spyware category that we got on the screen so that basically people are able to get into your machine and find out information the latest big one has been Apple's Cloud being hacked and all the celebrity photographs being exposed to the public um our banks have some of our banks have been hacked a few times and personal information has been made public so that's getting information out of it okay I thought malware was the same as spyware well malware is again it's it's more of a global sort of thing it's it's any software that's where male badw soft um part from software it's any software that has bad intent and it's um doesn't replicate which makes a different from a virus okay but it will sit on your computer and it will do a variety of things so some of it will create extra links it'll turn when you're searching on the internet for example all of a sudden you'll find As you move your mouse over your cursor over a word suddenly an advertisement will pop up and to get rid of that malware takes a lot of effort yeah that all antiviral software takes care of it yes I know I struggled with malware a while ago and managed to find another free download which sorted it out for me on top of the antivirus software I had as well that's it yes I didn't actually know that there was a difference up until then okay okay then of course there's antivirus software which we've spoken about and without selling any any particular product all you have to do is Google that and thousands of possibilities will come up and there's some really good companies that give it away for free because ultimately they do want people to be able to use the internet safely because it becomes an important way of them being able to sell other products yes exactly so it's not a bad thing at all so it's in their best interest to keep the flow of information coming to and from your computer safely definitely yeah and if they create a good impression by making you feel safe then obviously you're going to spend more money with them in other areas that's right yes back conspiracies and then the last Point safe downloads sfe downloads is is is just something that we got to really pay attention to you know every now and again you think G it would be so wonderful if I had some sort of software that would allow me to mark exams more quickly and you can Google it and I can almost guarantee you're going to find some or other software that would be able to meet those needs now good software places are few comparison to the number of places that have a little bit of malw or a bit of virus hidden within the software so they sort of send it out to you so you go off to the downloads you download something that's got hidden little friends that are going to damage your system so you need to go to to um places to download download software that are well known that have a good reputation and you know every time you find one place and want to download something if you just Google that and see what the reputation for that company is and you'll be able to quickly find out whoops there's a problem over here and read the reviews read the reviews yes I mean that's the Joy about the internet is it keeps reporting on itself yes so there's there shouldn't be surprises I don't think I have come across quite a few uh websites where you want to download a certain piece of software from that have been direct copies of the original website and and the way you can tell it's a copy is not by looking at the website but by looking at that address bar at the top and you'll see that the URL is not exactly how it's meant to be maybe it's got an extra s somewhere or that's right yeah so pay attention to you yeah I mean I think often what we do online is we just sort of look at the page we don't look at the at that top bar and I think it's critical and when we're talking about fishing in a minute I want to talk about that CU it's quite an important way of being able to solve the fishing problem well let's go to that okay that's those famous emails you get that tell you that you've just received from your bank a certain amount of money and all you need to do is log in yes click below and put in your banking details so that the transfer can happen now if you click on that link it opens up a apparent web page that is your Banks but if you look back right at the top you're going to find all sorts of curious www and then a whole lot of stuff before it gets to your bank name yes if your bank name is even mentioned anywhere in in the in the address bar so it's one way of actually being aware of what happening that the it was a fishing scam now fishing is um a bizarre term I suppose for most people and they wonder why but it comes from the notion of when you go fishing and you put in lots of bait now electronic um communication allows you to send out 10 million emails at one time now if you send 10 million emails to people and ask them to put in their banking details and only 1% you're the math person it's okay 100
 I definitely died  why are the weakness in biology because I just couldn't seem to understand it before I used to get 40 out of 100 and this really bothered me so then program was held in my school and then they introduced this Nigerian learning passport when I heard about it I went to go and check it on Play store and then I started learning them when I come out from school all the people doing biology I'll come and check it on the Nigerian passport I didn't say about Nigerian passports when I was in sa is one so I got A1 in physics that was first thing in essay Zone since then I couldn't make it to A1 again that's like getting C5 60 something I used the learning passwords in night before the exam and the last thing I touched on the learning password for a Nigeria learning passport was parallelogram law vector and that thing I didn't know it before so I was happy I did it in the exam when I go to my tooth my dad that I have confidence that I'm going to get A1 and I collected my results for seven times I got um the highest score into physics which is 80 over 100 A1 because you're a little passport uh it's a learning platform designed by federal government in partnership with UNICEF which is meant to address the issue of out of school syndrome and also to serve as a platform that whereby teachers are students can use to assist in the present confessional way of impacting knowledge what's Nigeria learning passport has come to do is to bridge the gap whereby teaching and learning can continue outside school where students are at home they can learn at their own time at their own pace they can learn and this learning passport is targeted towards the Learners who are the students it is targeted towards the Educators who are the teachers targeted towards the parents and the community at large so when I started using the Nigerian impossible and I started listening to the teachers I became well vast in biology more than I was before Ceramics of Education launched the Nigerian learning passport with support from UNICEF and Microsoft 2022 and also in Lagos uh it involves a lot of various teacher capacity development in which about 30 000 teachers across Nigeria were trained uh on how to use platform itself and also students were oriented however since I got to know methodologies and there's all particular aspects or needs fat simulation whereby so students to go into the laboratory to perform experiments so this platform creates an enabling environment for them to see what I think that it is abstract so we'll get familiar with it it is actually real you see it so you can perform experiment even without going to the lab it has really helped a lot it summarized all your subjects everything that you want to learn don't need to go to YouTube or looking for any apps on Play Store all you need is just this Nigeria learning passport and then you can see so many subjects videos that you could have watched on YouTube and also it's free for those that are using eteo foreign

hi guys welcome to my youtube channel  i'm londondego booger and i currently reside in johannesburg south africa you can also find me on social media at obtm on instagram and wtm on twitter the main reason of this video is just to take you guys on the journey that i went through when i was applying to become an online english tutor on the various companies that exist i'm just going to be highlighting the four different companies that i've applied to and the main reason why i think i was rejected on italki so stay tuned to the end of the video to find out why so the reason why i started this journey of wanting to teach english online is because i wanted to get more ways of making money for myself you know i do have a job but i was trying to increase my monthly income you know you can never have too much money and you can never stop hustling for my money so that's how this journey came about and yeah i through the process of trying to find ways to make money i came across learn with me's youtube channel and she was just talking about how she's making 12k a month teaching english online or night talking i'm like bro that is crazy money i need it expeditiously so that's how i ended up trying to get on these platforms and trying to make money for myself teaching english online so i've applied to four different platforms which are italki cambly prepley i'm going to talk about that native camp and tutor abc so tune in and i will get into these individually so i'm going to start off with um cambly i wrote everything down so don't mind me i'm just going to be lagging okay so with cambly you have the option of choosing between cambly adults and can be kids i chose uh campy adults because i feel like you need to have a lot of experience to teach kids and like with adults maybe i could just have conversations with him you know so that's why i chose um campy adults and then you have to fill in your tutor profile where you have to fill in your information about yourself your work experience your education teaching certificates if you have one and also just your teaching style and how you are as a teacher after that you have to record an introduction video an introduction in the introduction video tell them about yourself um why you want to teach what makes you stand out from other teachers you can just google like other company introduction videos and try to make yours similar to those and try to add more spices to make it stand out you know and then after that you have to complete a supplementary test which is like just a few questions and among those questions they ask you why do you want to be a tutor on campaign you know and then after that you do a connection test where they check whether your camera and your mic are okay for you to teach english online and then you submit the application so i did that and i submitted my application i think it's been like a week now i haven't heard anything from them and from the reviews that i got about cambly there's like a lot of people that have been applying they and they just haven't been getting feedback for results on their applications so i'm crossing fingers and hoping that i will get feedback soon you know as yeah i really want to get started and start doing this thing so yeah then uh the second platform that i applied to as native camp hi native camp okay so i found native cam because it was also one of the platforms that do not require you to have a tfl certificate nor degree even though i do have one i just chose to apply for platforms that don't require it you know so with native cam you have to fill in your own information and then complete an english proficiency test and in that test you need to score 80 and above for you to continue so i scored 95 so i was able to continue with the application and then you have a system check with with the admin so with the system check it's a live system check so you literally connected and you talking with them in real time and with that system checked there's like usually a waiting period when i was doing the application uh i was number five in line so i waited and waited and waited until i stopped let me tell you why i stopped okay so in that process where i'm waiting to to to to speak with the admin lady i start doing like research on the company you know okay let me find out more about it let me do some you know some research nyana and i went through the reviews and boy the reviews were so bad they were talking about how the lowest paying company and the company never favors the teacher you know so i was just so turned off by that and i was like um okay maybe this is not even worth it and what made me actually stop that whole process was because after you do that interview the system check with the admin lady you have to still do another demo live lesson and i'm just like boy this is too much i'm not doing this like yo now i chopped admin so like yo this is too much admin for me and i just cut the process right there and then the other platform that i applied to is tutor abc twitter abc is actually my favorite because of their application process like i felt like it was straightforward it was not nits and gritty like they just wanted straightforward information that i was able to provide and i enjoyed that about the application process um so with them you just have to fill in your information and then after that you'll be taken to an i tutor interview so apparently you get like two options between a live interview and an automated i didn't get that i was just passed straight to the automated interview and then from the automated interview um you're just responding to a robot and you have to do actions and act like how you would act if you were in a classroom like they give you real life scenarios so you should be prepared for that but other than that it's just seven questions and i found it really um comfortable for me as live interviews give me anxiety so like thank god thank god i don't have to meet anyone and do like an actual actual interview so that was great and then after that you have a proficiency test we have to answer like five short questions and then new submits then you're done easy enough okay so another platform that i've applied to was prepley um and i was under the impression that they do not require a degree nor do they require a tfl certificate so that's why i applied only to find out in the midst of it all that they do require as a tfl certificate or a teaching certificate so i didn't complete that application i was just like and another thing that also put me off was the fact that apparently the the tutors don't get paid for trial lessons so that means a hundred students could take trial lessons for like the whole month and you won't get paid like nothing nada so i was like yo yo there is no way i am going to dedicate that much of my time to not getting paid like are you mad so if i get like a thousand students and obviously they're all coming for the first time i'm not getting paid uh yo i was like nah next and then and then the real reason why you guys are here my italki application so with italki um like i said i did a lot of research about each company but i feel like i did the most research about italki because there was the platform that i first learned about teaching english online you know with the italki application you get to choose between being a professional teacher and a community tutor with the professional teacher you need to have the tfl certificate and with the community tutor you don't necessarily require anything you just have to be a native english speaker okay and then that you you choose the languages you're gonna speak and from there you fill in your personal information and then they'll require you to record a one to four minutes introduction video where you tell them about yourself tell them about your teaching style uh tell them what makes you stand out from other tutors and why students should book with you you can just watch other introduction videos and just tailor yours to that you know so you are kind of in line with their requirements excuse me and then you get to the teacher profile information where you have to fill in you as a teacher your teaching style your lesson and lesson material and with that i would suggest that you go and check other italki tutor profiles and see how they answer the question so that you can best answer because that's how i did it this second time so yeah after like a few days i got my response from italki and they rejected my application i was gutted i'm not gonna lie i was like out of like what this is crazy i was so hurt and then i was like okay let me reapply and then i went back to to my profile and it still had the same information that i submitted before and i realized that this certain information that i did not submit you know and i was like flip this is probably the real reason why they rejected my application so i would suggest that if you've applied and you rejected that you go back and recheck your application to ensure that you filled in everything correctly you know just so you're not thinking they rejected it for no reason because that's what i was thinking like ah these people ah why didn't you reject me yeah yeah i was like fighting you know kanti i didn't even fill in the information properly like so yeah um that's what i did and i would suggest that everyone else do the same and then reapply after a bit of time um yeah that's all the information that i have with regards to the application process that i've gone through and that i've done um i hope that you guys uh also took like some vital information if there was in this video
who come from uh middle and upper middle classes in Africa and those kids who come from poor families right so the poor kids are going to stay poor because they can't they don't have access to um the online process to apply for University admission so that's a that's a crucial difference right and it widens right the poverty Gap right and and so we're talking about educational we're talking about educational Equity here so the program that we run our digital learning the Global Alliance For Africa digital learning program is an attempt to address that internal digital divide and it it it works I mean it actually does work it's providing kids in very remote rural areas in urban slums um with uh ICT training and the capacity so that when they become uh uh students in their um third and fourth years in high school if they want they can successfully right apply for University admission online right and that's
one in today's world learning is changing with tech making it as dynamic as the students it [Applause] serves that's where the mobile classroom app comes in a platform that puts on the go learning right at the fingertips of Nigerian students according to the founder Akim salami the app was born out of a desire to bridge learning gaps using technology is actually an alen platform that was actually put in place like almost four 5 years ago so then it was actually for secondary school student where we put up like almost 1,000 video content for secondary school but in the recent time we extended the opportunities to T institions the lecturers in my institions coaches and facilitators anywhere built by team passionate about learning this app brings the classroom straight into the pockets of both students and lecturers we have uh different lecturers are lecturers on the platform so creating a space where students can engage with their studies anytime while also supporting Educators to share their knowledge beyond their schools there are two major things we have considered number one is that we look at how lecturers are being empowered we how can they take advantage of technology to advance their wellbe so we feel if lecturers can have a space of their own to preserve their intellectual hasset it means that students of other school who do not have the privilege to attend J will have the opportunity to take lecture from a lecturer un like for as long as the lecturer can take him better so we are trying to bring intra inter institutional expectations of intellectual material that you can be a student ofch mass communications and be taking lecture from student of un learning lecturer of un learning so this is what we have thought of to put this and secondly we also understand that with the way things are going in the world flexibility is a key things that we have to consider many students have to work and learn and how do they combine this if there is a sh time for them to take the lecture so if lecturers have put up their lecture video on their lecture space student at their own convenient time can have access to this content so in this case we feel them having access to their lecturers their content their lecture material video audio base at their own convenient time we enhance learning unique features of the app like my class and virtual tests that aim to make the learning and teaching process easier here Educators can create personalized classes and upload lecture materials and students can revisit these lessons at their own pace my class is just a replica of a sptify that is available for musicians or my CL is for lecturers to upload their intellectual materials recorded So that their student can have the opportunity to reassess their lecture at their own compenent time it's a kind of empowerment for lecturers too why also making Learning Easy for people why the virtual test is just to test people just like the lecturers in want to conduct the assessment test and they have to go through the rigor of writing testt on paper marking and recording now they can conduct the assessment test virtually while the platform is more than just a tool but an opportunity for both lecturers and students to stay on track with their academic goals for students the mobile classroom app means access to hundreds of lessons on any device any time they want and for lectures it's a chance to extend their reach Beyond traditional institutions which is a win-win for both sides
um my name is amlu shik uh I am a professor at University of California um Berkeley and I teach amaric language um I have a couple of books for Amharic Learners one is um let's learn Amharic alphabet it's purely for beginers and um it teaches the alphabet we call the alphabet inamar Fidel or Hau um and it's Unique a unique language um and one of the major languages in in Ethiopia and the second is uh Amharic for foreigners and the Ethiopian diaspora both of them are available uh on Amazon and you can search uh you by my name or by the title and I teach Amharic online and teaching Amharic um not justar but teaching online generally is uh not easy uh because you have to get your students motivated and I uh to do that I use different methodologies different strategies and one of the strategies is using games I use Jo joer games um by which students can be grouped into two and answer pick a number and answer different questions um and another strategy I use is I I use Music uh especially before class and in when I give them a break Break um and I play a m a music a certain music and um when uh the music when I stop the music I asked the students about what the music is who the singer is and um I use Music um in between classes to motivate students and then the other thing is I try to engage uh every student in class by asking um different questions by uh having them turn on their videos all the time and um calling names like they they get ready um because they they know that I might um um randomly call names and ask questions and I also split them into breakout sessions in pair or in groups so yeah I I'm trying to um use different strategies to make uh my students engaged and to make to feel like uh to have them feel like um an imperson class
e our lectures because you cannot be a lecturer supervising a student if you are not fully grounded in research yourself and um so we're working with our uh universities to develop a capacity building fund for early to M career researchers within universities that they can tap into help in terms of their capacity building continued professional development expand their Network and um take up the the the their role as research researchers because three there three core functions of universities research teaching and community service so that's one of the the initiatives that we're using to ensure that um um the trainers are also capacitated to supervise the students well and we can also use technology when it comes to um student writing skills and we know that we have a challenge we have we have people out there who will write desertation for students and um the way to do so is the way we can address that is ensuring that we ground the students really well in research methodology and if you have the cap the the lectures capacitated they will be able to pick up because everybody has a writing style so if if a student has submitted a proposal and they have a a specific writing style and then fast forward a few months they submit a dissertation that is beautiful to pick up that there's a difference in the writing style and we can also usey we have plagiarism software um in other parts of the world we can incorporate that into an education management system in seran where students will submit their work and um um um this tool will be able to to tell us if it's been plagiarized from some from someplace or not but I think ultimately if we ensure that we develop training material and we really ground the students in the principles of research and they understand then there's no need with time we will win them off this need to go and seek someone else to do their their research and also help them to start thinking about how they can publish their research findings and and contribute to to the general um body of knowledge s you've been taking not for a while are there particular things you would like to reference well I I was actually struck by the U question you asked about root learning and I think it has been a challenge in the basic education sector um and we have been um looking at Ways and Means of of addressing those um so if you look at the senior Secondary School curriculum we have core subjects which are basically the subjects that we are traditional subjects but we also have um applied subjects and and when you start to introduce Concepts like um applied subjects then the assessment methodology becomes slightly different because what you're now asking people to do is not just to reproduce the knowledge or the the the the the information that you've given to them but actually getting them to apply those knowledge and there are a couple of things that I've seen in recent um in recent times in in in seron that gives me room for um quite Joy I would say or Delight so for example I have witnessed a robotic competition and mind you this is not only I've seen it in the private schools I've I've also seen it in public schools um and this is students applying their knowledge in a competitive way I've also um recently went to a business speach competition where um seven schools competed um to present business ideas and I think it was won by the seon grammar school and my um school was also part of it um um the Albert Academy um we've also seen mock debates in Parliament and I have been extremely impressed with what we've seen there is uh there there are Clips on social media where they have debates in schools um these are all things that uh you know you're allowing that student to use their creativity the critical thinking and and and and and apply things we've started to see Project based learning in our schools we've seen um the way we ask questions and no longer close questions it's open-ended questions so that they have the opportunity to be able to open up and use their own critical thinking to to to in in the answers to the questions we've seen in some of the assessment methodologies that we are developing the use of real life um applications um and we've seen also portfolio building these are all techniques that you use in education to make sure that you move away from root learning where they asking you to um reproduce what you've learned to applying what you've learned and I think that um it's it it provides what I would call a thorough grounding for even the research skills that you will need later on in in in in in University I've observed with Keen interest that um the appetite for reading has wul dropped in serum people are not interested in Reading any longer and that has badly or affected the the quality of Education in s what people don't understand is that um reading books actually add to your knowledge base you know vocabulary arsenal of words and everything else exposes you to the real world and what reading the thoughts of others can improve education tremendously and uh the doctor alas spoke about you know having soft skills some of these soft skills can be gotten from reading all the books topics other areas you know how do you think we can Revitalize the culture of reading in s I'll start with you Mr Zaki okay thank you very much first of all let me just address the issue of soft skills um in our foundational Landing package um seron is rather unique and I often go abroad and I talk about this and very confidently and and I'm very proud that we've taken the the the approach that we' have taken normally when you talk about foundational learning people consider literacy and numeracy as the key in seron we do five components we have literacy we have numeracy we have socio emotional skills so those soft skills are developed through social emotional skills now it's not a um a separate subject it is applied in the teaching of literacy and numeracy we also have digital skills and the last but by no means the least is civic education um and again you know our history from the war so we need to be more tolerant and learn to live with each other so civic education runs through the entire spectrum of what we deliver so that's how we we we we we we we promote foundational learning the issue of reading I I must say again this is an interesting one it is not peculiar to seron even in the UK kids don't read anymore the reason being they have to compete with their computer games they have to look they have to compete with watching Tik Tok you know as opposed to reading Mills and Booms which I'm sure my colleague Minister read quite a lot of because I know her vocabulary is very broad you know in our days we used to have those war comics you know which was my age um but these things things are no longer there because the competition that you have with social media is quite it's quite it's quite quite ver however we have recognized this and we are working with the World Bank to develop supplementary reading list so with the World Bank we're going to work with the S Library board to provide additional reading materials on top of what we have in the academic requirements yes so that's how we intend to do it but I think also seriously we have a problem these days our kids are exposed to things that we were not exposed to and you know that 5 minutes Tik Tok can give you an Insight but it doesn't mean that you read you don't pick up vocabularies you might have the Insight but not necessarily the vocabulary but this is how we have planned to approach that you introducing supplementary reading materials for old schools and certainly in the early years Doctor we're rounding off now um my household we like John grisham's series a lot you know my wife he she eats them quite a lot and I've also grown love for John Gish do you still read Milton boom well I don't know where my colleague got that information I am I was more into Sydney n Sheldon and and John Grisham and Bon okay so yeah I do I do read um I must confess that I don't read as much as I used to read before um um but then in my in my line of work you have to read you have to be updated as to what is happening um um not just in country but in in other countries that are similar to yours so to see what can you potentially learn from that and adapt to the context of seral okay so I think it goes without saying reading is is part and P of who I am just take a few messages as we round off this morning um Ibrahim sen abir is saying Dr Minister it is important to align University training with the interest of the corporate world particularly the area of Entrepreneurship however most universities in San lack the necessary technological resources uh for students to apply their studies in Practical settings additionally University fees are rising every year making it difficult ult for low-income families to afford education compounding the issue um the government has stopped providing Grant in a support education is only making progress on social media but in real life it is the opposite our s toay is saying good morning a and thank you for hosting the education ministers my concern is with the recruitment of tech V teachers who don't have TC or HTC as that is the requirement set by the teaching Service Commission M of Dak is saying our academic sector is full of challenges because of the lack of proper monitoring from the school level to the university it's sad it it's sad when people are receiving salaries at the end of the month without any dedication the classrooms and lecture places are empty because of lack of monitoring um OS friend is uh saying education being a systemic a systematic process of training the mind with knowledge the nation the nation's education capacity of individual beneficiaries seems um ons spawn discovery of these ons spawn talents needs um a well tailored approach to speed out talent to meet with globalization including practicalities steaming from digital evidence-based approach um Dr wuri our tary system is um frustrating as a result of the attitude of University workers annually students grades are missing and the new Academic Year will start without student uh not knowing their faith whether they will be promoted or not um OS friend is saying again has the UN has the ministry of technical has the Min of TX education rectify the issue of homebased science science student scholarship fund there was an issue with those funds um redirected to few International students leaving the homebased student to fend for them to fend for their funds in pursuit of science careers are these funds going to um well going to be ring fenced MOS D saying the difficulties with um with the critical thinking and or thinking outside the box approach in our education system is I believe uh has to do with a kind of tradition focusing on learning say allance education system from Colonial to postcolonial era was mostly based around the traditional Department of Law and Medics these departments with all due respect are focused more on reading and comprehending the applications needed for these disciplines lawyers studying particularly law uh be it natural or international law commercial law constitutional law Etc similarly for the Medical Department the same practices apply in my experience and probably many other students for my era many if not all teachers would actually query us for attempting to write our exams in our own words they rather preferred word from word for word approach pure common sense is the father of textbook education when this is tapped into and transformed for human consumption to yield National development and also friend is saying that da tar is saying our education system is not fit for purpose we are using yesterday's knowledge to train today's children for tomorrow's technology we have students in our universities reading bit and can't even explain how artificial intelligence works mosd is saying our education um in case of distant or open Learning System is quite interesting and Innovative however the challenges um we face as a country makes it harder to almost almost impossible taking into consideration the lack of proper energy supplies and quality internet access probably only reach in our society could afford this at the moment improve the library standard reduce the university fees and reduced the syllabus then we will begin to have a successful graduate swissman is saying these are the messages um so far that we've recorded U Mr s would you mind to start yes but let me start off with the issue of um Quality in our schools um again I did in my previous submission I did say that the focus now in terms of education is on improving quality the first um Step that we have to take is to review the role of the school quality assurance officers and we are working with an organization called laran we developing a new framework for our quality assurance officers and and what I really want to is you know if abroad when an inspector goes into a school you will know whether at the end of that inspection whether that school is up to a certain standard or not so they grade the schools whether they outstanding whether they are are good um fair and satisfactory and so on and so forth in our system there's no grading so you don't even know whether that school has met the minimum standards that you have in education this is what I want to change I want to make sure that when a quality assurance officer goes into a school I would know whether that school is meeting a minimum standards the parents will know that that school is meeting the minimum standards the community will know whether that school is meeting the minimum standards let me also address the issue of attendance of teachers and attendance of pupils so we have a new we're using um technology um in a program called we are we which gets um the school leaders to register the attendance of teachers using biodata so they either use their thumb print or they use facial recognition with that there is a dashboard which I will have access to in the ministry and I click of a button I could tell you which schools are below um The Benchmark for attendance and which are not and those who are below the Benchmark we will make sure that our quality assurance officers um going to those schools to see how they can support them initially and if there's a question of leadership we will make sure that we address that um there's one other thing that I wanted to um that we are working on at the moment and I say it's work in progress so I wouldn't want to go too much into detail about this several years ago in London there were certain schools that were underperforming invariably the schools that were underperforming were the schools where you have black kids um a predominant of black kids so the political leadership at the time decided that this cannot be right it is not Equitable um it doesn't promote equal opportunities and so they started a program called the London challenge which is a comprehensive framework to support schools that are underperforming we are working on something similar okay right now because I want to make sure that when we talk about um radical inclusion we are not just referring to individuals we want to make sure that the institutions are radically included in the high quality that we want and no school should be left behind irrespective of where that child that school is located and that's something that we are working on um right now and it's something that once it's ready we will make an announcement doctor thank you very much um so there was a question about um the granting Aid scheme and um someone also mentioned about home form based fonds being diverted to International students this is the second time I'm hearing that and my response has always been that has never been the case um the granting Aid yes we have we had to put a pause on the granting Aid scheme because it had the best intentions to remove the financial barrier but then in reality it has it had it had its own challenges when I assumed office I inher inherited backlogs going back to 20 13 2015 thereabout wherein the the the Govern we we owed learning institutions money um that we had given students by the granting Aid scheme so we have introduced the the loan scheme the students loan scheme and for now it's been piloted for post-graduate students so for the first year it was piloted for postgraduate students and now it's been made available also of a postgraduate student and we can all agree that if you want to in when you introduce something newly you're not going to go full fce you do it gradually and Lessons Learned you used to scale up so funds are not being diverted to international student that they have separate budget lines and that is not the case but what we are doing for the granting Aid scheme is that we are retaining a component of it that's yet to be launched and there are specific groups that we have identified so one um female students studying specific steam um subjects so science technology ology engineering Agriculture and Mathematics and there will be a quarter for that and we will Define what those those um sub those fields will be linked to our national development plan and the reason why we've um we we're introducing that for female students is because these are sectors that are historically dominated by men and we have the guy act saying 30% minimum female representation in leadership positions to ensure that we do not play Leap service to that we have to train the Young women now so they can take up the leadership roles Within These these um um um historically male dominated um sectors and change that narrative so um the the that would we also have um a category for persons living with disability and other categories we have the scholarship policy which we've recently revised and that would may be made available to the public which clearly um will in in in the interest of transpar transparency will spell out what the different categories are there was also another question about um missing grades yes that's an ongoing challenge where students their grades are not submitted on time they have no they they promote themselves and it creates a whole lot of problems that will entail us working with the universities to strengthen their governance structures internally they have governance structures we strengthen that and ensure that we have clearly defined roles and responsibilities clearly Define timelines and we work towards that that's for the short term in the medium to long term we're looking to use technology there's a concept note that we have developed um called smart where we want to have dedicated ICT spaces so multi-purpose ICT Suites that will be utilized for digital skills training um um um research learning and and all of that but also to be used for exams and that will help in terms of efficiency and transparency and accountability as well there was also a question about um odl but then it's it will be it will introduce another layer of inequality whatever we do within the ministry of Technical and higher education we do it through the gender equality social justice and inclusivity lens we do not introduce something that will disadvantage some students and only those who can afford able to access that so we're working with Partners so first Green Technology green energy so if we have these multi-purpose ICT Suites they will have green energy so we don't have to um deal with the issue of of of power cots and whatnot and then we're working with a a partner to introduce um sustainable and reliable internet connection into all of our higher educational institutions in a phased approach that will ensure that you have the space so if you don't have a device you can go and access um use this ICT space it's you have sustained um um Power and you have sustained reliable internet connectivity so that way nobody's disadvantaged and um there's also another question about um textbook way of learning and this also links to the point the question that you raised earlier and just to add to that so critical thinking is something that we need to instill in our young people and I mentioned the platform that we're developing with the partner in India so there will be a component of critical thinking U module in there but also the way we assess so it's not just about you learning and regurgitating what you have learned but thinking outside the box how you can apply what you have learned in a real life setting in in the form of assessment we also have internships dual apprenticeship policy that creates a partnership with industry players what a young person will be able to have on the job training and be able to see in real life what they have learned being applied in a real life setting and help them to think outside the box and move away from this textbook way of doing things thank you very much indeed Dr hauri she's a minister of Technical and higher educ and before her you've been listening to um the minister of higher education um Technical and higher education and that is Mr Conrad saki um this morning we've gotten a 4K picture of what exactly our education system looks like in San at the moment we wish you well and we do hope to be having you subsequently on our additions of this program thank you so much thank you very much"
 welcome to soga college e-learning platform in this video i'm going to demonstrate how to access your account as a user if the user is a student a user is a teacher or any person subscribe to this learning platform go to any of your browsers installed on your computer or laptop for example in this case i'm going to use google chrome here this one double click on it to open and be patient until it opens the rate at which toppings depends on the speed of your internet connectivity there we are it is opening point opens like this go to the url bar this is what you call the url bar type the
