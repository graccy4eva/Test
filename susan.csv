1,"The MortalySis dashboard appears to be a comprehensive and valuable tool, seamlessly integrating data exploration, visualizations, and predictive modeling for enhanced insights into in-hospital mortality factors. Its user-friendly interface is likely to facilitate efficient analysis, contributing to improved healthcare strategies and resource planning."
2,"Nice dashboard, can be useful for surgeons. It would be nice to have a more concise interpretation of the model metrics like precision, F1 score etc. for surgeons/non-technical folks to infer. It would benefit them if this is in lay man's terms as well as helps them infer results from the data quickly."
3,"It feels suitable for medical professionals, but I feel that the information presented should be made much easier and comprehensive for end users. Given that, not every end user might understand the graphs correctly."
4,"It looks simple and also easy to use. Without using it, but just based on the video demo, I think there is a little too much scrolling needed. I think it would be nice to have a general overview of all the key factors, or at least highlight the important parts in the data. I think that would help the user to quickly see what needs most attention."
5,I saw the video and it doesn't require any pre-requisites to be followed to understand what is a user supposed to do.
6,"I think an overview of everything and highlighting any key information the user needs to know would be helpful. I also think less scrolling would help and depending on the context, the user may not have the time to scroll through and select so many things."
